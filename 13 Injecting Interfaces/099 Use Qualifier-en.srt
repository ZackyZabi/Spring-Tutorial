1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,960
The PBS lecture we have seen know no Inuk been an exception because our interface was implemented by

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,250
multiple classes and putting good and figured out which implementation could inject.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,640
So to avoid that problem first of all we need to give our beans means to go to order deal with impulse

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,740
give it that name is the name of the object reference or call it the label.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,500
The first big name will be the table or the second one R D will embellish to the component give it a

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,490
value card.

7
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:43,450
Be able to once we do that come back to the Art of War impulse and then we are doing the auto wiring

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,620
use the qualifier within brackets.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,640
You have done this earlier but that was with classes.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,570
Now we are doing it with interfaces through interfaces qualify or be a will that will inject offspring

11
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,950
will inject this bean because that is the name we have used on the component right here.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,360
Later on the test and see if the exception goes away.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,000
This time it injects be able impulse and that is the reason we are seeing inside Aradia will create

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:25,830
art to go to the bee will impel one more time change it to be able to insert and they will see the power

15
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,620
of putting past and it injects Attardi impulse to this time.

16
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,110
So we are wired unique been not found exception.

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,660
We use the qualifier and on the component we go to all the implementations and name and spitting uses

18
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,350
that name and it creates the object and we use it inside the qualifier and we inject the dependency.
