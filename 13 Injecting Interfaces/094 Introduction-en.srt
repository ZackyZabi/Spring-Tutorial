1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,910
So far you have been creating places and that objects and injecting them back in real time job obligations.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,070
We often create interfaces that is we always quarter to interfaces for abstraction.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,230
For example here we have an order bill which is a class that holds all the business logic for the order

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,350
to place an order.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,170
These are the be will is an interface and it will be implemented by a class card arder be Will.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,200
I am it has it easy relationship with our beagle.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,740
Similarly we have an order to be able which contains not the business logic but all that data access

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,410
called it could be JTB see hibernate etc. all that gold will go into the order.

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,200
It connects to the database and does that work.

10
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:58,510
Again this order is an interface and it will be implemented by arder will impact this order be will

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:08,380
depends on r r d r r r b will impel the relationship as a relationship with order to be able not to

12
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,280
inject arder Diego into our hobby will impel.

13
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,300
We do not or we cannot create an instance of this interface.

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,490
So we provide the implementation in our spring configuration will be providing this class of details

15
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,240
in the bin so that spudding can inject it into the RB will impact.

16
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,220
So the steps will remain the same.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,270
We will be creating for porgies plane or the Jawa interfaces and play all the java objects create the

18
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,990
configuration and finally create the test class.

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:50,100
Do the first step in this lecture that is creating the interfaces and classes go to eclipse minimize

20
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,610
everything.

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:58,900
How one of them expanded so that we can copy the configuration and test reichlich new interface.

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:07,990
We should always code to interfaces back his name com dot dot dot Supreme Court advance a dot injecting

23
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:20,490
dot in Dunner face this and the interface name should be are to be will which will have the business

24
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:30,370
logic method the one and only matter this will have its place on the net returns nothing.

25
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,520
Wired plays are the mighty fall.

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,740
Its public abstract create a class for it right click new class.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,030
So if you are right click on that interface will create the class you the name.

28
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:56,370
We will I am will be gone and search for arder we will select that hit.

29
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,120
OK.

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,530
Finish automatically.

31
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,430
Eclipse will override the place.

32
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:12,240
Our method for us simply sits out in the matter it sits out inside Arta be your

33
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:25,050
let's create the next interface which is the order to be able to write like create new interface or

34
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,160
to be able finish this already.

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,010
Well we all have one single method called create Varda.

36
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,190
This would create the Arta in the database.

37
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,060
Typically these methods will have parameters here I am not adding all the complexity because we just

38
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,360
want to see how interface injection works.

39
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,590
Right click new CLOS arder you.

40
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,250
I am the implementation.

41
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,980
Click on Add search for Arta be able select that it OK.

42
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:09,440
Finish and ready to delete that to do this out in side

43
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,490
order you will create order.

44
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,130
That the next lecture will copy or the test and the configuration and will make the necessary changes.

45
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,310
This should be in side order do you.
