1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:08,650
A simple hello controller that will greet the user if he sends his name from the web browser. To do that,

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:20,940
go to the springbootweb project, source and right click on the package. Say New -> Class, call it HelloController.

3
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:32,090
Put it in a package called web.controllers. Finish. To make this a controller, you need to mark it

4
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,260
with @Controller annotation as you have learnt from the Spring MVC section.

5
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:47,440
Now that's a controller. Next, create a method that will send a greeting back to the client.

6
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,680
public String hello()

7
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,960
and it will get a user name. Given a name, it should simply greet hello and the name. return, within double

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:05,670
quotes, hello, space, +name. Control+Shift+f to format.

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,620
Do the RequestMapping for this method. You know how to do it.

10
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:17,900
You have learnt it from the Spring Web MVC Section. @RequestMapping is the annotation we should be using.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,220
Within double quotes, in the brackets provide a RequestMapping. /hello is what the user should be using

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,380
from the web browser to access this particular endpoint or this particular method.

13
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,510
And since we are returning a string, we need to use

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,620
@ResponseBody. You want to send the response back in the HTTP body.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,090
And this needs to be marked with @RequestParam.

16
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,450
This will be passed in as a URL param from the web browser later on.

17
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,370
So in this lecture, you have successfully created a controller class and implemented a method called

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,710
hello, which when given a name, it will simply return hello

19
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,220
and that particular name.
