In the previous lecture, we have seen a Spring Boot Web MVC application

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,350
in action. In this lecture, I will show you how to customize a few properties

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,890
by using the application.properties.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:20,220
We had to access our application without the context last time, because by default the Spring Boot Web

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,000
applications are configured to run at localhost:8080 on a Tomcat instead of having a

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,960
root context. When you deploy a war file, it will automatically have

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,150
a root context, but in this case we are deploying our application as a jar file instead.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,830
So to configure a root context, go back to application.properties and type server dot, and you will see

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,490
all the properties you can configure for a server. server.context-path,

10
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,550
context-path=/springbootweb. You can use whatever name you want.

11
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,510
You can simply call springweb as well if you want to.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,180
There are several other properties, server.port, etc; So you can even configure port if you want to.

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,240
By default it runs on 8080. Save, stop the application, re-run it or relaunch it.

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,220
This time we should be able to access it using springbootweb as the context from the web browser.

15
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:32,260
So before hello, use springbootweb/hello and we still get the same result back.

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,030
So that is how we can customize, without writing any xml or even Java configuration,

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,180
you can configure your application or you can customize the application.
