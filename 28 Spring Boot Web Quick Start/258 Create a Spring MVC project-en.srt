00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:09,570
In this lecture, you'll see how easy it is to create a Spring Boot Web MVC project using STS. Go to the file menu,

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:18,480
say New -> Spring Starter Project. Give your project a name, call it springbootweb.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,550
Change the group to

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,700
com.bharath.spring.web instead.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:36,810
Same with package, the package should be com.bharath.spring.web or let's follow the convention spring.boot.web.

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,810
Next.

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:50,080
Here, search for web and select the very first one under web which is web. We need the web dependency.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,440
That is the only dependency required as of now. Finish and that will create a Spring Boot Web project.

9
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:04,160
Expand it and open the pom.xml which is the important Maven configuration file. Click on the last

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,450
tab, double click to maximize. We have the maven coordinates with the project information.

11
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,300
The parent project as always is this the spring-boot-starter-parent. We have some properties which

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:24,330
specify the Java version. And the important section is the dependency section, wherein you see the

13
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:34,410
spring-boot-starter-web is the starter project for the web MVC projects while using Spring Boot. And the test dependency

14
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:42,280
as always and also the plugin that will create a jar file of our project and we'll be able to run the

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,090
jar file because, it will have the embedded Tomcat inside it and automatically it will launch our application

16
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,890
on localhost:8080 as you will see in the next few lectures.
