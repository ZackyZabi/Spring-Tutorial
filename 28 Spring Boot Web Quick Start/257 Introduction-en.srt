00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,870
In this lecture, you will learn how Spring Boot simplifies the creation and launch or deployment of Spring Web

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,820
or Spring MVC projects. To create a spring MVC project,

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:20,220
all we need to do is to add a dependency called spring-boot-starter-web to our pom.xml.

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,170
Once we do that, we can create controller classes and you can use all your knowledge that you have

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,030
gained from the Spring MVC section. And our application can be run within, from within our IDE without

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,590
creating a war file or without deploying it to a server because, Spring Boot comes with a embedded Tomcat

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,040
server that goes into our application. You'll be seeing all that in action and I'll explain it, at the end

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,640
of the hands-on lectures I will show you how the jar file will look like and what internally happens.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,640
And even better,

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,000
we need not configure the Dispatcher Servlet,

11
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,110
nor the Internal View Resolver, all that will come for free.

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,740
Once we start using the Spring starter dependency, Spring will automatically configure all these

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,810
for us. And if we want to customize the Internal View Resolver configuration, we need not create any XML

14
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,330
or Java configuration.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:24,960
We can simply use the application.properties file and add properties like spring.mvc.view.prefix, etc;

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,780
I will show you where these properties exist on the Internet and how you can refer to them.

17
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,090
So the key to remember is that Spring Boot simplifies the creation of Spring MVC projects. It takes

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,470
out a lot of configuration as well as it comes with an embedded Tomcat server that allows us to run our

19
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,350
applications as jar files from within our IDEs, or we can even deploy the jar files to a server.
