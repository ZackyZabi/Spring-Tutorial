00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,550
By going to the Resources section of this lecture, you will be able to download all the slides or the

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,880
presentations that I have been using throughout this course.

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,180
Once you download it, it will be a zip file. Unzip the contents of it and you will see all the presentations organized

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,720
by topic. You can start with Spring Core or any other topic you are interested in.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,930
Once you go in there, you will see both .key files for Mac and pptx for Windows.

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,530
So each topic has both these type of files.

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,290
You can use them for quick review or even do presentations and train your colleagues and friends.

I'll be adding lot more lectures and sections to this course pretty soon.
