00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,840
In this lecture, you will configure the InternalResourceViewResolver as a bean in the Java configuration.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,690
To do that, by now you know how to do it.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:17,140
Public, it should return the view resolver from Spring.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,450
viewResolver is the method that returns it. Inside

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,410
this we'll create a ViewResolver

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:56,080
or InternalViewResolver. InternalResourceViewResolver resolver = new InternalResourceViewResolver();

7
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,030
Create an instance of it, then we have two things to set on it. Before we do that add a written

8
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,760
statement so that we will not see all those errors and we successfully return the resolver.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,760
If you go back to the dispatcher-servlet we set up a prefix and suffix.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:24,440
So grab the prefix, copy that WEB-INF/views, come back to the configuration. resolver.setPrefix();

11
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:43,990
Come back, within double quotes set the prefix. resolver.setSuffix(). Within double quotes you know what it is.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,310
It is ".jsp".

13
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,230
The extension of our views, within double quotes provide that information. And you have to mark this method with

14
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,150
an annotation.

15
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,790
If you remember, it is the bean annotation that tells Spring that this method will return a Spring bean.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,120
In the next step,

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,380
we have one last thing to configure in this configuration file or one method that you should override and

18
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,850
we will be done and we can delete the dispatcher-servlet after that.
