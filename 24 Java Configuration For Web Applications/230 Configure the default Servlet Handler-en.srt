1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,800
In this lecture, you'll configure one last thing in the Spring configuration which is the default

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,560
Servlet handler. Although it's not required in this particular usecase you should know about it.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to explain each of these again at the end of all the lectures.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,770
First, Configure it and I'll explain what it is.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,850
Type in configure, hit control+space and we have several methods which you can override from the

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,200
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:38,530
Select ConfigureDefaultServletHandling. That's the method we want to override.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:47,940
It gets a DefaultServletHandlerConfigurer as a parameter. Delete these two lines here and simply use

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:57,390
the configurer.enable. You are overriding this method to tell spring that the default handler

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,660
in the web container whereever our application is being deployed, in this case Tomcat, should handle all the other

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,070
requests.

12
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,190
That is, once we configure the dispatcher-servlet, the dispatcher-servlet is going to handle certain kind

13
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,710
of requests. Do a forward slash because we are going to map. If we open the web.xml right now

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,730
a dispatcher servlet is configured for forward slash.

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,400
It can serve everything that is there in our application.

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,710
But if there are any HTMLs that we want the web container to handle, the dispatcher need not

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,500
handle the HTMLs or any static content.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,320
So that is where this comes very handy.

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,400
We are telling spring that it should delegate the responsibility to the default servlet handler that

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,450
comes with our container, which in this case is Apache Tomcat.

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,070
So we are done configuring the Spring configuration and we can delete the dispatcher-servlet

22
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,820
at this point. Right click, do a Delete.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,920
And we got rid of one xml, we have one more left.

24
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,530
We'll get rid of that one in the next few lectures.
