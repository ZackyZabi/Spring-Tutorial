00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,750
In this lecture, you'll learn how to migrate the spring MVC web application to use Java configuration instead of xml based configuration.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,470
If you expand this project in your Eclipse IDE, go to src/main/webapp/WEB-INF

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,130
and you will find two configuration files. One ofcourse is the web.xml which is the deployment

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,670
descriptor for our web application where we have defined the Spring dispatcher servlet which is our front

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,010
controller.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,800
The second configuration file here is the dispatcher-servlet.xml.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,230
This is the spring configuration file which we intend to replace.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:48,060
You're also going to get rid of the web.xml and use Java configuration there as well. In the

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,570
dispatcher-servlet.xml, we have define the context:component-scan telling Spring which packages should

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,450
be scanned for our controller classes.

11
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,430
If you go to src/main/java all our controllers are under this particular package.

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:11,310
If we see, atleast one of these controllers working after our migration, then we are good.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,060
The second bean here is the InternalViewResolver or InternalResourceViewResolver which resolves our

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:28,350
JSP pages. Build this project and run it on the server. Run As -> Maven Clean just to make sure it's still

15
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:35,780
working and we are all set. Right click, Run As -> Maven install.

16
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,570
Once that completes, you can run it on the server.

17
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,880
Right click, Run As -> Run on Server. Finish.

18
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:58,030
That will launch the default page which is the index.jsp which says Hello World!

19
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,150
Type in hello

20
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:07,090
at the end because our hello controller is configured to use that URI pattern. hello, Enter.

21
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,200
And that takes us to the HelloController which redirects it, after setting some information it will

22
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,040
redirect it to the hello.jsp which is under WEB-INF/views/hello.jsp,

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,390
and it displays all that information.

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,300
That is what we are seeing here.

25
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,750
So this should exactly work the same once we get rid of the web.xml and dispatcher-servlet.xml

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,150
and replace it with Java configuration.
