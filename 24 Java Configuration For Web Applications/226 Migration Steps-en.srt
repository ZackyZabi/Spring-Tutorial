00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,570
You will migrate the spring MVC project to use Java based configuration instead of xml in three

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,950
simple steps.

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,210
The first step is to update the pom.xml. We'll update the pom.xml by adding the servlet dependency

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,530
as well as we will add a war plugin. And I'll explain why we need to add a war plugin when you do it.

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,900
The second step is to replace the dispatcher-servlet.xml with Java configuration.

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,890
You'll be creating a Java configuration class for it, annotating it overriding the methods that are required.

Last and final, we'll get rid of the web.xml, and you'll be replacing it with a class that implements

WebApplicationInitializer from Spring.
