1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,730
In this lecture, you will create a Java configuration file that will replace the web.xml.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,080
We'll split it into two lectures as always. We'll do few things at a time.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,600
So right click on the package, create a new class. Call it WebConfiguration or WebServletConfiguration.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,570
WebServletConfiguration and this should implement an interface from Spring.

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:35,520
Click on add and search for WebApplicationInitialiser. Select that interface, WebApplicationInitialiser.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,200
Click Ok, Finish. And there is only one method that we need to override, it is the onStartup method, which gets

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,890
a servletContext. Delete the todo. Hit control+d and create a

8
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:07,540
AnnotationWeb or AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext. Not the AnnotationConfigApplicationContext

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,010
application context which you have used when you worked with the standalone Java applications for configuring

10
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,710
standalone job applications.

11
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:22,810
This is AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext, call it webContext is equal to, create a new instance

12
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,200
of it.

13
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,400
And register our configuration, webContext.register().

14
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,910
The class is SpringConfig.class.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:45,230
That is our configuration file. Control+space, SpringConfig.class, and we have successfully told

16
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,080
the web configuration about the Spring configuration class. In the next lecture,

17
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,840
you will configure the dispatcher-servlet dynamically within this WebServletConfiguration.
