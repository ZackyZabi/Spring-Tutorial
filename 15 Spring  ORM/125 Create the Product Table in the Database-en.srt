In this lecture, you'll create a database table which you will be using throughout the Spring ORM usecase. To

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,950
do that, download the springorm.txt file from the resources section of this lecture.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,360
Open it in your favourite text editor once downloaded. Do a Control+a, copy it, Control+c, go to MySQL workbench.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,170
Open a File -> New Query Tab, paste the contents there.

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,710
The very first line is to switch the database or go to a particular database.

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,940
Use mydb, mydb is my database. In your case if you have a different name please switch it to that and

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,240
then use this command. Execute it. That will change the database to mydb.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,370
The second command creates the product table.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,400
There are four fields, id is an integer, name is varchar(20),

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,540
description of the product varchar(100), price is a decimal. Here 8 is the total number of digits that

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,300
can be stored in price and 3 is the number of digits that can go after the decimal point. Select

12
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,250
that, execute.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,230
That creates the product table.

14
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,340
Execute the select statement or query.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,860
Right now there are no columns or there is no data in the product table.
