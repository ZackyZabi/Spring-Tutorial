1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,490
In the previous lecture, you have successfully implemented the find method which returns a single record

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,510
from the database as an object.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,570
In this lecture, you will learn how to read multiple records. That is,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:20,550
we should get a list of products. Let's implement that method, list of products is what it should

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,470
return in the ProductDao.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,370
Call it findAll, everything in the database, no parameters to it. Control+1, import the list from

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:37,130
java.util. Go to the ProductDaoImpl all the way up, control+1 on the error,

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,620
add the implemented methods which is the findAll method.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:50,890
Delete the TODO. hibernateTemplate.loadAll is the method.

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,580
It takes the entity type.

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,560
We need to tell it what type of records are going to come back.

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,590
It's Product.class generics

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:08,870
again. We are telling that it should return a list of product types. Control+1, assign statement to

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:19,460
a new local variable and it returns a list of products. And return that products back. Control+shift+f to format,

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,900
its products.

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Go to the test.

17
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,950
Comment out this find method.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:46,270
productDao.findAll is the method.

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,270
Hit control+1, assign statement to a new local variable.

20
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,110
It returns a list of products back.

21
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,620
Display those products.

22
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,620
Run the test.

23
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,670
And we have two products. Here is product 1, the first record and here is the second record.

24
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,850
So you should use the get method when you are loading a single record and you should use the

25
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,060
hibernateTemplate.loadAll to load all the records in database table.
