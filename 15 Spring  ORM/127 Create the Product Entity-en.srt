00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,720
In this lecture, you'll create the very first class in our application which is the product entity. The product

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,350
will represent the database table which is product.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,040
It has four columns, id, name, description and price.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:26,930
So let's go back to Eclipse. Close all the poms, right click, close all. Go to the src/main/java, expand the

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:37,340
package, get rid of App.java, delete it. Right click on the package, say New -> class, Product.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,760
This is our entity.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,320
Entity represents a database table,

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,970
springorm dot, the package name should be entities or entity. entity the package name.

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,250
You can also use model, model or entity they are both synonyms. Finish.

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,770
Double click to maximize, we need to add four properties here.

11
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:10,100
Private int id, private int or private string name, of the product.

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,520
Private string description.

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:19,460
I'm going to use desc just to show you that the property names need not be same as the database column

14
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,470
names in the database.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,960
It is description, but I am using it as desc. You can map it to the database column.

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,550
You've already seen that in theory. Private string, the last one,

17
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,310
it's not a string.

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,900
It's going to be a double, value.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:46,030
Sorry, the price. You can select them all, go to a src or source, generate the mutator methods which are setter

20
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,250
and getter methods. Select them all. And here,

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,990
instead of first member change it to After 'price'. Hit

22
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,120
Ok, do a control+shift+f to format.

23
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,680
We have created a java bean. It's not an entity yet. To make it an entity we need to mark it with the

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,570
appropriate JPA annotations.

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,020
Let's start with the very first one if you remember, @Entity.

26
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:23,180
That makes this class an entity. Hit control+1 and import entity from javax.persistence, not from

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,100
hibernate, it should be from javax.persistence.Entity.

28
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,260
The next mandatory annotation is on the id field,

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,870
you should use a @id. Control+space,

30
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,440
id from javax.persistence.

31
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:48,430
These two are mandatory and the rest of the optional ones, table, @Table, this class should map

32
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,570
to a database table. javax.persistence is the package. Within brackets,

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,690
name is equal to product.

34
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,740
This is not mandatory unless your table name is different from the class name.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,730
That is when we use this @Table. But it will be much more clear if we use this annotation,

36
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,100
doesn't hurt. And the next set of annotations are @Column, the last annotation is

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,760
@Column from javax.persistence again.

38
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:29,750
Inside this we can use name is equal to name, copy that, paste it above id, also paste it for description

39
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,010
and price.

40
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:40,040
Change the names, name is equal to id. For a description column name is not desc, it should be description,

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,630
description, that is what it is in the database.

42
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,510
And finally, the last one is price.

43
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,090
Now our Java bean has turned into an entity. In this lecture, you've successfully created our product entity.
