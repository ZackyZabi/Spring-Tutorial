00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,640
In this lecture, you'll create the Spring configuration file and configure the very first bean which

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,220
is the DataSource bean. Go to Eclipse, double click to minimize, grab the configuration from the previous

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,580
project, go to Spring JDBC, src/main/java. Go to the test folder under Employee.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,200
That is where we have created our config. Copy that config, close that, come back.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:34,340
Right click on this package, say New -> Package. We'll create a subpackage called test. springorm dot product

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,230
dot test, finish. Paste the configuration.

7
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:47,780
Maximize it or expand it. Open the config.xml. Get rid of everything except for the DataSource. Leave the

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,160
DriverManagerDataSource as it is because we are going to need that bean. Delete this context:component-scan

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:03,440
and JdbcTemplate. We'll add whatever we need later on. And remove all the spaces. And you have successfully

10
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,230
created the configuration and also configured the DriverManagerDataSource. In the next few lectures

11
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,860
we'll create all the other beans or we'll configure all the other beans.
