1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,280
In this lecture, you'll configure the LocalSessionFactoryBean which is an implementation of the

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,320
SessionFactory and which does most of the work.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,060
This is the biggest portion in our configuration file.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,610
So let's get started. This LocalSessionFactoryBean needs three properties or three dependencies, the

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,500
DataSource, HibernateProperties, a property called HibernateProperties which are key value pairs or

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,640
properties.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,760
And finally, a list of entity classes.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,330
Let's get started by going to Eclipse, the configuration file.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,890
Create a new bean, class is equal to, within double quotes,

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,330
its the LocalSessionFactoryBean.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,740
We know the class name but we don't know the package.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,430
So do a control+shift+t, search for LocalSessionFactoryBean

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:59,440
and you will find that. Grab the one which has the package as hibernate5. Don't use 4 or 3.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,360
We are using the latest, select that. Grab the entire qualified class name which has the package name,

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,450
copy it.

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,580
Go back to the config, paste it within double quotes.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,220
Make sure you don't have any spaces. Name is equal to, call it sessionFactory.

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,260
Close it right there.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:28,750
And the very first property is the DataSource. Let's use p-schema. P colon, data, s capital, source

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,460
is equal to, within double quotes,

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,940
grab the dataSource name from here and paste it.

22
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,480
We already have the dataSource bean. It has two more properties.

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:49,580
Let's set them. Property, the first one name is equal to hibernateProperties, p capital.

24
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,190
It's hibernateProperties.

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,810
Close that. And within the property element we need to configure key value pairs.

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:06,650
Props is the element because it is of type properties. The first prop, key is,

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
you know this,

28
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:16,730
hiberate dot dialect. This is the dialect class that generates the SQL queries from our entities

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,870
or for our entities.

30
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:26,840
Since I am using MySQL database, we need to search for MySQL dialect. Do a control+shift+t, search

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,100
for Mysqldialect.

32
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,890
If you are using Oracle, you will search for Oracledialect.

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:41,160
Select that from hibernate. Copy the entire package name starting from here.

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,810
Package, grab that, go back to config.xml,

35
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,610
paste it in between the prop tag for value.

36
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:58,140
Create another property, the second and the last property that we'll be configuring. Prop key is equal

37
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,280
to, within double quotes,

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:07,170
hibernate.show_sql. This is a boolean property, by default it is false.

39
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:16,950
It should be prop, not prope. Make it true. This tells hibernate that when it generates the queries, when

40
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,390
this dialect generates the queries,

41
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,580
those queries should also be displayed on the console.

42
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,840
You have successfully configured both the properties.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:39,570
The last property that we need to set on the SessionFactory, the name is annotatedClasses,

44
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,160
c capital. And its list of strings.

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,640
Use the list element and we need to pass in the class names which are our entities. Within the list,

46
00:03:51,650 --> 00:04:00,480
we can use value. Go to the product entity, grab the package name up to entity, come back to the config.xml,

47
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,540
paste it, dot, p capital, product.

48
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:14,630
This property tells hibernate what all are our entities and it will grab them and it knows how to interpret

49
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,340
these annotations inside that entity.

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,290
So in this lecture, you have successfully configured the SessionFactory, the LocalSessionFactory from

51
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,990
Spring which implements the SessionFactory interface from hibernate.

52
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,410
You have injected the dataSource which is the first dependency.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,080
You have also provided the hibernateProperties,

54
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,290
the two key properties, hibernate.dialect which generates the SQL queries and also a property called

55
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,800
hibernate.show_sql which prints the, which tells hibernate that it should print the SQL queries

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,960
on the console.

57
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,880
And finally, a list of annotated classes, in our case we only have one entity.
