1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,300
In this lecture, you'll configure one of the last beans which is the TransactionManager. This is an interface

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,600
and the implementation of it is HibernateTransactionManager.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,940
So go to Eclipse, to the configuration. At the end,

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,020
we are going to add a new bean. Start the bean tag, class is equal to HibernateTransactionManager but

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,300
we need the package name. Do a control+shift+t,

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:32,610
search for HibernateTransactionManager and grab the one from hibernate5 package, everything should

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,910
be from hibernate5.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,670
Select that, copy the package name and the class name. Come back to config.xml, paste it in between

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:50,380
the double quotes, get rid of any spaces at the beginning or at the end. It should be HibernateTransactionManager

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:01:02,630
from hibernate5. Name is equal to transactionManager, the only dependency the transactionManager

11
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,190
has is the SessionFactory.

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:14,080
So it works around the SessionFactory, it creates a transaction around a hibernate session. So inject it, p colon

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,380
sessionFactory, f capital, is a property name, hyphen ref.

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,560
It is of object type.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,610
Within double quotes, grab the name from here, paste it, close the bean tag.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,840
Do a control+shift+f to format. We have successfully configured the transactionManager. Spring will create this.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,460
But to use the transactionManager to create a transaction,

18
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,990
we need to add a few more elements here.

19
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,180
You need to introduce a new namespace.

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,140
So copy this c-schema namespace.

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,270
Enter, paste it. Change this c to tx for transaction.

22
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:56,700
We are adding a new namespace for transaction, tx. And at the end,

23
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,400
we also need to add the schema for that namespace.

24
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:09,280
So copy the last two entries, the context, enter, paste them. Change context to tx. For this namespace

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,470
which we have defined here,

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,320
the schema file can be found at the following locations. So change, wherever you see context change it to

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,570
tx. Schema slash, not context, tx.

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,700
That's it.

29
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,730
So you have successfully configured the transactionManager and also got the namespaces .

30
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,560
We can use transactions in our application,

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,910
Spring transactions either through XML or annotations. To use the XML or annotated way

32
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,800
of doing it,

33
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:50,450
you should use tx:annotation-driven. That's it. That tells Spring that we are going to use annotations to

34
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,130
do transactions.

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You will use the transactions later on.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,090
You'll use the annotations in the next few lectures.

37
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,870
To summarize, you've configured the transactionManager, added the namespaces so that we can enable

38
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,400
transaction management and also youve given a schema file for it.
