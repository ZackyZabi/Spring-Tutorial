1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,820
In this lecture, you will work on the very first step which is to create the Maven Spring ORM project

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,100
in Eclipse.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,840
To do that, go to the File menu, say New -> Maven project. Click on the next button.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,940
Leave the default option as it is,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,200
which is maven-archetype-quickstart for standalone projects, click Next.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,170
The Group id is fine, com.bharath.spring.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,120
That is what we have been using. The Artifact Id or the project name should be

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:40,140
springorm, all lowercase, springorm for object relational mapping. Finish. And we have our maven project.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,090
Click on the, double click on the pom.xml, open it. This is the Maven configuration file.

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:54,760
Click on the last tab, go to the previous project which is springjdbc. Open its pom.xml.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:03,010
Go to the last tab, double click to maximize. Grab everything from properties all the way till end

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,170
of build section, just before the project ends.

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,330
Copy it.

14
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,680
Come back to the new pom.

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,550
Delete everything from properties all the way till dependencies and paste whatever you've copied. Do control+shift+f.

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,980
And you know what's next.

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,570
We have to update the dependencies, you're going to delete some dependencies or one dependency which is

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:32,760
the spring-jdbc because we are going to use spring-orm, we don't need spring-jdbc. We need the

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:40,520
spring-core dependencies to do dependency injection and we need the mysql JDBC driver in my case.

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,870
If you are using Oracle that would be a different driver.

21
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,590
And we need two additional maven dependencies, Spring ORM

22
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,680
is the first one and Hibernate Core is the next one.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,340
This is the ORM implementation, hibernate that we are going to use. Go go back to Eclipse.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,410
Copy one of the spring dependencies, paste it right next to the spring-context dependency. Do a

25
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:11,280
control+shift+f to format. And change this context to spring-orm.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
That is all that is required.

27
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:21,610
This is the Maven dependency to grab spring-orm. The next one is Hibernate Core. To get that dependency,

28
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,980
go to your web browser,

29
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:34,830
open up Google and search for hibernate core maven dependency. Click on the first link.

30
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,810
I am currently using 5.2.5.

31
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,700
You are welcome to try out the latest that is out there, but I'm going to grab 5.2.5

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,150
because I have been using it and there were no issues with it.

33
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,270
Scroll down, click on this text area and it will be copied to the clipboard.

34
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,610
Go back to Eclipse, right after all the spring dependencies and before the sql-connector paste

35
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,790
our new dependency. It could go anywhere.

36
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:08,580
Just having a logical order in here. Delete this link. Control+shift+f to format. If you want to add a property

37
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,240
for this version you can do that here.

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,910
But since we have only one dependency we are not using this version multiple times.

39
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,930
I'm going to leave it as it is.

40
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,340
Now we'll see some errors.

41
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,310
You know what to do. Get rid of the tests. Go to the src/test/java,

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,950
right click on the package.

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,820
Delete it. You have done it quite a few times by now.

44
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,850
And once we update the pom.xml, right click on the project, go to maven and update project. That

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,000
will fix everything for Maven.

46
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,170
It will pull the dependencies and all the errors are gone.

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:50,890
So you have successfully created the Spring ORM project and updated the dependencies and also you have

48
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,020
the compiler plugin in place which tells maven that it should use Java 1.8.
