00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,940
In this lecture you will implement the delete method in the ProductDao and delete a particular record from

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,310
the database. Go to the ProductDao, void delete is the method.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,010
And all we need to give it is a product entity.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,770
And it should have a

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,910
Id inside it. It need not have the other information.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,470
All that is required is the id field. Go to the ProductDaoImpl, control+1, add unimplemented methods.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:40,880
Go all the way to the end, control+d to delete that. Use the hibernateTemplate.delete and pass it the entity

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:50,330
which is product. Do a control+shift+f to format. Mark it with @Transactional, don't forget to do that. Go to

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,920
the test

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:03,430
and comment out the update. Do a ProductDao.delete and pass in the product.

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,080
We have only one product record in the database.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,070
Let's go to the database, do a select operation to make sure that we have a record.

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,290
We do. So come back, run the test.

14
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,900
See what statement is being generated.

15
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,590
So it does a select first internally and then it does a delete.

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,520
So it's fetches the record and then it deletes it internally.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,520
So let's go to the database, do a select operation and there are no records.

18
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,610
So you have also successfully deleted the record.
