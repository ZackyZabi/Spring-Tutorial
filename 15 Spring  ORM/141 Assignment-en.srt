00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,070
To work on the hibernate use case or the ORM use case we are going to reuse the table from the Spring

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,150
JDBC.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,060
It's kind of a migration project where we are migrating from Spring JDBC to ORM or using

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,250
Hibernate.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,950
So we'll reuse the passenger table that's already there in the database. Copy over the Passenger class from

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,640
the earlier project so that you can make it an entity. You'll do that using the @Entity annotation

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,780
and the @Id annotations which are mandatory. And optionally,

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,300
you can use the @Table and Column annotations.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,000
Once you make the Passenger a model object or an entity, you will then configure the SessionFactory and the

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,590
hibernateTemplate

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,650
in the spring configuration. The dataSource, you can ofcourse you need to configure the dataSource

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,370
which will be used by the SessionFactory and hibernateTemplate. And once you have it, create a test

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,810
class and perform the crud operations using save, update, delete, get which will get one single record

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,060
and loadAll which loads all the passengers in the database table.
