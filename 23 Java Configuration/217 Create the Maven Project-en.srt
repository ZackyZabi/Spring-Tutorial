In this lecture you will create the maven project so that we can start working on our case.

1
00:05.610 --> 00:18.180
So go to eclipse File menu new go to other and type in Maven select Maven project click on next next.

2
00:18.180 --> 00:25.540
Again select the default which is archetype QuickStart is a standalone project.

3
00:25.540 --> 00:28.020
Next again give it a name call it

4
00:28.180 --> 00:38.220
spring Java config spring Java config finish that will create the Maven project for us.

5
00:38.290 --> 00:39.490
Go into it

6
00:39.520 --> 00:42.850
Go to the source test Java right click on the package get rid of it.

7
00:42.850 --> 00:44.180
We don't need that.

8
00:44.200 --> 00:46.840
We're going to update the pom in a second.

9
00:46.840 --> 00:47.540
Go to the source.

10
00:47.540 --> 00:48.510
Main Java.

11
00:48.580 --> 00:50.800
Delete the app as well.

12
00:53.200 --> 01:00.580
Open the pom file which is the maven configuration file go to to pom dot xml tab go to the spring core

13
01:00.580 --> 01:01.010
Project.

14
01:01.000 --> 01:03.450
The very first project that you have created.

15
01:03.670 --> 01:11.100
Open the pom dot xml once it opens up to the last tab double click to maximize.

16
01:11.230 --> 01:18.850
Copy all the way from properties till the end up to the build end not to the project element from properties

17
01:18.910 --> 01:25.630
all the way to build come back to the new project spring Java conflict pom start from properties

18
01:26.470 --> 01:32.460
and copy all the way up to dependencies control shift F to format

19
01:32.470 --> 01:38.770
So we have copied a property called Spring version and the dependencies we need are spring core and

20
01:38.800 --> 01:39.690
spring context.

21
01:39.700 --> 01:46.420
That's all we need to develop standalone projects using Java configuration and we have the maven

22
01:46.450 --> 01:52.840
compiler plugin defined so that our Java version is one point eight starting the next lecture you will be

23
01:52.840 --> 01:55.900
using spring Java configuration.

24
01:55.990 --> 02:02.040
But before we do that right click on the project and always do a maven update.

25
02:02.270 --> 02:13.370
right click go to Maven and do a update project every time we touch the pom file we should do this and no more

26
02:13.440 --> 02:13.950
errors.
