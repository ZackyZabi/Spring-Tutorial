This lecture you will work on the next layer which is the service layer, we'll create a service class that will

1
00:06.390 --> 00:09.830
use the Dao by Auto wiring the dao onto it.

2
00:09.840 --> 00:12.290
And then we will use it in the Test class.

3
00:13.670 --> 00:14.910
go back to the project.

4
00:14.930 --> 00:19.710
Right click on the package new class call 

5
00:19.760 --> 00:22.540
it service finish

6
00:27.330 --> 00:34.440
this service is going to use the services provided by Dao  at Auto wired.

7
00:34.440 --> 00:35.080
We want to.

8
00:35.160 --> 00:36.140
auto wire.

9
00:36.180 --> 00:46.890
This dao onto the service and within service will again have a method called public void safe which will

10
00:46.890 --> 00:50.460
invoke the Dao dot create

11
00:53.570 --> 00:59.980
go back to the spring config and we need to add one more method that will return the new bean public

12
01:00.370 --> 01:01.460
service.

13
01:01.730 --> 01:08.430
Service is the method name return new service.

14
01:08.750 --> 01:16.360
Again this is similar to bean element in spring configuration if you are doing a xml based configuration.

15
01:16.370 --> 01:21.020
This is like a bean element when you mark it  with at bean annotation.

16
01:21.020 --> 01:24.360
If you don't mark it then it doesn't have any value.

17
01:24.360 --> 01:27.950
Spring will not invoke this method it will not create a bean.

18
01:27.950 --> 01:30.930
So this is important here.

19
01:31.160 --> 01:34.860
Go back to the test instead of Dao dot class.

20
01:34.870 --> 01:42.640
This time we are going to retrieve service class and on the left hand side it'll be service bean.

21
01:43.060 --> 01:48.490
And it not be create, it will be save instead on the service it is called Save on the dao

22
01:48.490 --> 01:51.600
It's called create rerun the test

23
01:54.580 --> 01:56.410
and it still says it is created.

24
01:56.410 --> 02:03.040
That is the method on the servies is invoked which is say which in turn invokes creates the container

25
02:03.040 --> 02:04.040
starts

26
02:04.060 --> 02:05.970
It will go to the configuration file.

27
02:06.100 --> 02:12.290
It will create these two beans it knows that the service bean needs the dao bean so it will first create

28
02:12.330 --> 02:18.440
the dao bean then it would inject that in because we have auto void that on to the service part of

29
02:18.620 --> 02:19.430
it.

30
02:19.450 --> 02:27.060
Then when we get that bean in the test class and invoke the method at the appropriate save method is called.
