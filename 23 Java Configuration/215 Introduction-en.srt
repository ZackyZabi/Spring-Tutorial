00:00.510 --> 00:08.280
Starting 3.0 version of spring we can configure and use spring without using any xml in our application

1
00:08.700 --> 00:16.260
that these complete Java based configuration will be replacing xml with a java class that will be marked

2
00:16.260 --> 00:21.110
with at configuration annotation from spring ones marked

3
00:21.120 --> 00:27.610
this annotation tells spring that this particular class is a source of spring beans.

4
00:27.660 --> 00:31.020
This class will be our configuration starting from that point.

5
00:31.020 --> 00:35.800
This will be like the xml file when we used xml configuration within this class.

6
00:35.910 --> 00:42.590
We will define multiple methods which will return the instances of our Beans here.

7
00:42.590 --> 00:48.110
This particular method should return a new car instance and these methods should be marked with

8
00:48.440 --> 00:55.760
at bean annotation that being annotation is similar to the bean element we used in the xml to

9
00:55.790 --> 01:02.180
Define spring beans we can have multiple configuration files are multiple java classes in our

10
01:02.180 --> 01:06.440
application and each of them will be marked with at configuration.

11
01:06.440 --> 01:11.810
we learn all that and use all of that in the next few lectures then we build standalone applications

12
01:11.840 --> 01:17.860
instead of using xml class path application context to use our configuration.

13
01:17.870 --> 01:21.530
We will be reading annotation config application context.

14
01:21.530 --> 01:29.330
This is the container using this we can get the string beans out of it and we will also learn how to

15
01:29.360 --> 01:35.360
import one configuration inside another configuration so we can define multiple configuration classes

16
01:35.630 --> 01:41.150
and we can use the at import annotation to import them into other classes as well.
