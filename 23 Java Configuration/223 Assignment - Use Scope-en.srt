You've already learned that by default all the spring beans are singleton that is spring only creates

1
00:07.160 --> 00:13.820
one instance of any particular bean by default and you can change it using scope already tried all

2
00:13.820 --> 00:16.220
that when you do Java configuration.

3
00:16.280 --> 00:18.950
You can do that if you go to Spring config.

4
00:19.130 --> 00:27.260
There is an annotation which is called which you can define right here at the bean level and annotation

5
00:27.380 --> 00:33.530
is at scope and you can provide it a value within double quotes which could be a singleton prototype

6
00:33.530 --> 00:40.750
exectra I want you to explore it and in the Test class create two instances or invoke the Get bean method

7
00:41.360 --> 00:45.380
twice and check out the hash codes on those instances.

8
00:45.380 --> 00:52.800
If you say dao dot hash code see the values a new singleton which is the default both the values

9
00:52.800 --> 00:55.720
should be same when you create create two Dao's

10
00:55.820 --> 01:04.050
both their hash codes should match when you use Prototype S-Corp then the values should be different.

11
01:04.070 --> 01:11.390
You have already played around with scopes but this time it's going to be on this method using the at scope

12
01:11.510 --> 01:12.160
annotation.
