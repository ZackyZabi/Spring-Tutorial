00:00.330 --> 00:07.330
The next step is to create a test class that will use an annotation config application context which

1
00:07.410 --> 00:16.950
is a standalone spring container that can read off a Java configuration to do that go to eclipse right click

2
00:17.190 --> 00:23.890
create a class call it test with the main method finish.

3
00:26.330 --> 00:32.470
Control the application context.

4
00:32.880 --> 00:39.130
Context is equal to a new annotation

5
00:42.320 --> 00:44.940
config application context.

6
00:48.140 --> 00:53.780
You can either pass it as a constructor argument or you can use a Method called register to register

7
00:53.780 --> 00:55.070
that configuration.

8
00:55.070 --> 01:00.300
So here we have the spring config which is the configuration you can pass that right here.

9
01:00.320 --> 01:10.560
spring config dot class if you have additional configurations you can use the context dot register is

10
01:10.570 --> 01:16.190
the method and you can register as many configurations as you want but the register method is not available

11
01:16.250 --> 01:17.600
on the application context.

12
01:17.630 --> 01:24.020
It is a method specific to the annotation config application context so on the left hand side you should

13
01:24.020 --> 01:30.170
have the annotation configure application context then you will be able to context dot register if you

14
01:30.170 --> 01:38.240
want to and you can register as many Java configurations as you want which can return beans for us.

15
01:38.240 --> 01:42.580
Next step will get the bean out of the context context.

16
01:42.590 --> 01:49.710
DOT get bean passin the class name which is dao dot class.

17
01:50.530 --> 01:57.880
hit control one assign statement to a new local variable and that will return the DAO bean for us 

18
01:58.800 --> 02:04.750
Do a sysout dao dot create the method and we want to see what the output of that will be

19
02:04.820 --> 02:11.640
So create will be a void method so we don't how to use the sysout simply invoke dao dot create do

20
02:11.640 --> 02:16.660
a control shift O to get there up get rid of the unused imports.

21
02:16.760 --> 02:24.660
Right click run as Java application and you have successfully void a spring

22
02:24.660 --> 02:27.480
Bean using Java configuration.

23
02:27.480 --> 02:29.720
So the container is loaded.

24
02:29.730 --> 02:37.740
you see here and it reads the Java configuration creates a spring Bean because this method is invoked

25
02:38.130 --> 02:40.020
which is marked by at bean.

26
02:40.020 --> 02:46.050
It has the bean created and in our test class we are retrieving it from the container using the Get

27
02:46.060 --> 02:48.390
bean method and invoking the method on it.
