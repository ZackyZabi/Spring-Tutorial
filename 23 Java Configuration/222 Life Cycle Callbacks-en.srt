Everything that we do with xml based configuration can also be done with java configuration.

1
00:05.700 --> 00:11.190
In this lecture you will learn how to configure the lifecycle callback methods for a spring bean using

2
00:11.430 --> 00:13.610
Java configuration. To do that,

3
00:13.610 --> 00:22.150
Go to the service dot Java and the life cycle methods which are in it and destroy public void init

4
00:22.390 --> 00:27.430
Sys out within double coats init brackets.

5
00:27.450 --> 00:33.480
Open and Close save it copy it paste it call it destroy.

6
00:33.660 --> 00:36.540
You can call it Clean-Up if you want to or whatever.

7
00:36.670 --> 00:42.990
We have the init and destroy methods now go to the spring conference which is the configuration where

8
00:42.990 --> 00:48.030
we define the service instance on the bean annotation.

9
00:48.030 --> 00:50.480
We have several attributes that can be used.

10
00:50.730 --> 00:51.820
Open and close the bracket.

11
00:51.810 --> 00:54.210
Hit control space.

12
00:54.210 --> 01:02.070
There are init method destroy method and more select init method is equal to within double chords

13
01:02.120 --> 01:06.320
specified the name of the init method which is init  comma.

14
01:06.870 --> 01:10.290
destroy method is equal to destroy.

15
01:10.420 --> 01:12.890
So the method names themselves could be anything.

16
01:12.940 --> 01:19.640
Here we are using init and destroy because that is what we have on the service method.

17
01:20.020 --> 01:31.220
He change this test to destroy the test rerun it right click run as java application and you

18
01:31.230 --> 01:38.280
will see only init being called and then of course the created message that comes from Dao or save.

19
01:38.370 --> 01:44.520
But the Destroy is not getting called that is because our program is being terminated and we haven't

20
01:44.520 --> 01:52.500
closed the context properly so context dot close that will cause the spring container to shut down

21
01:52.500 --> 01:57.350
properly and that should invoke the destroy method rerun the test one more time.

22
01:58.870 --> 02:05.740
And this time you see in it Created and then when the spring container is shutting down it calls

23
02:05.780 --> 02:08.770
the destroy method on our object as well.
