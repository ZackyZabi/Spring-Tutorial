00:00.240 --> 00:06.060
Two masters java based configuration you are going to work on a very simple use case where-in you will creative

1
00:06.360 --> 00:08.980
DAO class which is a data access class

2
00:09.120 --> 00:10.620
it will not really talk to a database

3
00:10.620 --> 00:15.570
in this case and a Service class , service class uses the

4
00:15.630 --> 00:21.720
services provided by the dao class you will define a Java based configuration so we'll create a

5
00:21.720 --> 00:27.300
spring config dot file within which you will define all your beans and then it will create a test

6
00:27.300 --> 00:31.730
class that will read the beans from the container which is

7
00:31.770 --> 00:34.260
Annotation config application context.

8
00:34.270 --> 00:36.900
It will pass this spring conflict to this container.

9
00:36.900 --> 00:38.060
It will create the beans.

10
00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
Then it will read it

11
00:39.140 --> 00:42.520
from your test class first will do it in steps.

12
00:42.600 --> 00:44.400
First create the Tao.

13
00:44.490 --> 00:50.850
Wire it using spring config that is the Java config and then test it out and then we'll create

14
00:50.850 --> 00:56.900
the service class which will use the dao will wire service as well and then test that piece as well.
