00:00.300 --> 00:06.720
In this lecture he will create the deal class and also Configurate using the spring configuration

1
00:06.720 --> 00:12.960
or spring Java based configuration and in the next lecture will create the test and retrieve our dao

2
00:12.960 --> 00:15.440
from the spring container.

3
00:16.190 --> 00:24.110
Go back eclipse go to our newly created Project right click on the package name say new class call it DAO

4
00:24.120 --> 00:27.140
Now let's keep it simple.

5
00:27.420 --> 00:36.300
This dao will have one single method called create public void create it will not have any database calls

6
00:36.540 --> 00:38.520
simply add a sysout.

7
00:38.610 --> 00:41.840
Then double coats create it.

8
00:41.850 --> 00:42.570
It's lying.

9
00:42.570 --> 00:49.780
It's not really creating it add it component annotation.

10
00:49.830 --> 00:52.190
This will be a spring component.

11
00:52.200 --> 00:56.960
The second step is to create the java configuration.

12
00:57.420 --> 00:58.680
It's very easy.

13
00:58.890 --> 01:06.960
Again right on the package say new class call it spring conflict

14
01:09.590 --> 01:10.860
finish.

15
01:11.000 --> 01:17.720
We need to mark this class with a annotation called at configuration that tells the spring container

16
01:18.050 --> 01:25.300
that this is this class is spring configuration and to configure our bean inside this configuration

17
01:25.680 --> 01:32.270
will create them at their public it should return a dao  instance and you can call it Dao since it

18
01:32.270 --> 01:41.430
returns a dao inside that method you simply return and new dao.

19
01:41.580 --> 01:47.250
This is similar to how you configure a bean inside the application context dot xml or the config

20
01:47.270 --> 01:50.520
dot xml which is the configuration file for spring

21
01:50.690 --> 01:56.630
But you should mark this method with at bean annotation from Spring.

22
01:56.660 --> 01:57.550
Hit control 1.

23
01:57.560 --> 02:04.550
Imported from org spring framework context annotation configuration org spring framework  context

24
02:04.730 --> 02:11.450
annotation bean when you Mark a method with these spring container we know that that particular method will

25
02:11.450 --> 02:14.940
return spring bean instance.

26
02:15.260 --> 02:21.860
So you have successfully created a class called dao and we have also created your first Java configuration

27
02:21.860 --> 02:28.100
for spring and marking a class with at configuration and a method that returns the instance of the

28
02:28.100 --> 02:28.620
dao.

29
02:28.620 --> 02:30.080
and you have marked that method with

30
02:30.100 --> 02:32.140
at bean annotation.
