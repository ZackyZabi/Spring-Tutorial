This lecture you will learn how to configure the spring life cycle methods using spring interfaces.

1
00:06.390 --> 00:09.180
So far you have done it using spring configuration.

2
00:09.240 --> 00:14.190
Now you're going to do it using spring interfaces you're going to reuse these three classes from this

3
00:14.190 --> 00:17.520
package by creating a new package.

4
00:17.520 --> 00:25.470
So right click on this folder or package say new package instead of xml config

5
00:25.480 --> 00:27.810
Change it to interfaces.

6
00:27.810 --> 00:34.500
We are going to use the spring interfaces to implement the lifecycle methods copy these three from

7
00:34.500 --> 00:40.980
xml config package paste it expand open those three patient

8
00:40.990 --> 00:46.460
dot java or pojo the test dot java will remain the same no matter whether it is xml config or 

9
00:46.580 --> 00:51.190
using interfaces we are not going to change anything here.

10
00:51.420 --> 01:04.530
Goto patient dot Java and we are going to implement implements initializing bean control one import

11
01:04.600 --> 01:12.020
initializing bean from spring or dot string framework dot beans dot factory that is the package for it

12
01:12.020 --> 01:19.370
control one had control one and implemented amateur's the very first method is after property set

13
01:19.620 --> 01:21.410
is amateur's in this interface we need.

14
01:21.440 --> 01:22.370
All right.

15
01:22.370 --> 01:25.640
This is the init method public void

16
01:25.670 --> 01:26.790
No parameters

17
01:26.850 --> 01:30.620
the method name is after properties or set.

18
01:30.680 --> 01:35.430
This method will be invoked sysout within double coats.

19
01:35.540 --> 01:47.340
Inside after properties set save it the next interface for the destruction or the destroy method is

20
01:47.370 --> 01:52.200
comma after initializing bean we need to implement  disposable

21
01:55.920 --> 02:03.680
bean disposable bean from Spring Framework import that it's from the same package control one

22
02:03.690 --> 02:08.550
control one again to implement the methods

23
02:08.630 --> 02:14.120
go to the end just scroll it down and you see the destroy method. The destroy method

24
02:14.130 --> 02:16.860
the name is also destroy

25
02:17.120 --> 02:27.720
do a sysout double coats inside destroy and in the config dot xml we don't need these

26
02:27.710 --> 02:28.890
two the init method

27
02:28.940 --> 02:29.840
And destroy method

28
02:29.840 --> 02:33.340
Because we are already implementing those interfaces.

29
02:33.410 --> 02:40.880
We only configure the bean in the config dot xml spring will automatically see that this bean is implementing

30
02:40.880 --> 02:47.820
these two interfaces from spring and it will invoke the after property set and destroy methods. In the

31
02:47.940 --> 02:48.310
test

32
02:48.310 --> 02:50.870
We still need this register shutdown hook.

33
02:50.990 --> 02:58.370
This tells the container that before the container is shut down it needs to use this hook which will

34
02:58.370 --> 03:06.420
invoke the destroy methods lets run  the test right click change the configuration instead of xml

35
03:06.420 --> 03:07.260
config

36
03:07.260 --> 03:14.180
The conflict is now under spring core LC hype forward slash interfaces.

37
03:14.550 --> 03:22.810
That is the package name we have used LC dot interfaces that becomes LC forward slash interfaces

38
03:23.160 --> 03:34.050
right click run as Java application inside the setter method there is a class cast exception.

39
03:34.190 --> 03:36.420
We should go back to the test

40
03:36.440 --> 03:37.520
We need to change this

41
03:40.240 --> 03:41.050
patient here

42
03:44.180 --> 03:50.810
should be patient from patient dot java but in the config dot xml we need to change the package name this

43
03:50.810 --> 03:53.760
here should not be xml config

44
03:53.780 --> 03:56.070
This should be interface's as well.

45
03:56.090 --> 04:02.270
So we are trying to cast one type of patient to another type or class type that is the reason we are

46
04:02.270 --> 04:08.150
seeing that exceptions are changed to interface's rerun the test.

47
04:08.200 --> 04:14.810
Now we will see that it creates the object invokes the setter methods then it invokes the after property

48
04:14.830 --> 04:16.370
set method which is the init method

49
04:16.390 --> 04:21.060
then we use the object and then the destroy gets called.

50
04:21.370 --> 04:28.840
So in this lecture you  we have successfully learned how to configure it and estimators by implementing initialising

51
04:28.840 --> 04:35.560
being disposable bean and by operating the after property set then that's try methods.
