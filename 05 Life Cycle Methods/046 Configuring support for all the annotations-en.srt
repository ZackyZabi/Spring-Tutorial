In the previous lecture you have enabled support for these two antotations the life cycle annotations by configuring

1
00:06.900 --> 00:11.850
a bean called common annotation been post-process in the configuration file.

2
00:12.120 --> 00:17.430
There is also a way to configure all the annotations support in spring.

3
00:17.430 --> 00:24.150
We do that using the context namespace or an element from the context namespace in spring which is defined

4
00:24.150 --> 00:24.690
here.

5
00:25.570 --> 00:28.340
Here is the namespace prefix called context.

6
00:28.690 --> 00:35.080
And this is the schema for it and the name of the element is this the recommended way and the most

7
00:35.080 --> 00:41.340
used way and most of the realtime applications context colon annotation config.

8
00:42.140 --> 00:49.640
Thats it you can close that element right here and we don't need this bean anymore because we are asking

9
00:49.640 --> 00:56.540
springe to enable annotation support for all the annotations although we only use two annotations right

10
00:56.540 --> 01:00.940
now post construct and pre-destroy run the test again.

11
01:02.610 --> 01:05.960
And the output inside the setter method 

12
01:06.010 --> 01:08.740
Inside the hi method we use the object

13
01:08.740 --> 01:11.980
And finally inside the Bye method.

14
01:12.140 --> 01:18.540
So in this lecture you have successfully learnt how to enable annotation support in spring for all the annotations

15
01:18.570 --> 01:24.710
using context namespace and an element called annotation hyphen config.
