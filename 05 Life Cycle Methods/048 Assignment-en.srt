00:16.950 --> 00:19.220
from spring and inside the method

4
00:19.350 --> 00:23.780
simply use system dot out dot println and print that you are inside

5
00:23.790 --> 00:31.640
the initialize method inside the clean up method and write a test class and see everything in action.

So you have to create this mark it with the annotations enable the annotations in xml configuration
