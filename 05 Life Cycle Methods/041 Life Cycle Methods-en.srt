Spring provides two life cycle methods to every bean it creates.

1
00:04.830 --> 00:09.170
They are the init method and the destroy method.

2
00:09.250 --> 00:15.040
The names need not be the same but the signature should be exactly the same it should be public void

3
00:15.340 --> 00:16.870
and no parameters.

4
00:17.730 --> 00:23.160
Any initialization code such as loading some configuration file from the file system or connecting to

5
00:23.160 --> 00:27.950
the database or connecting to a web service or a server can go into the  init method 

6
00:28.050 --> 00:34.920
We put that code inside the init method and all the cleanup code that is closing the connections or cleaning

7
00:34.920 --> 00:39.110
up all the objects should go into the destroy method.

8
00:39.220 --> 00:45.730
The lifecycle looks as follows given a spring bean and xml configuration to the spring container the

9
00:45.730 --> 00:50.310
spring container will first instantiate an object of the bean.

10
00:50.380 --> 00:53.710
It will then set all the values onto that object.

11
00:53.920 --> 00:59.830
Then it will invoke the init method whatever code we put into the init method will be executed at that

12
00:59.830 --> 01:00.220
point.

13
01:00.250 --> 01:05.330
After the data is set into the object.

14
01:05.380 --> 01:12.040
Then we read the bean make use of that bean in our application and once we are done and before the container

15
01:12.040 --> 01:18.640
is destroyed or object is destroyed the destroy method  will be invoked before the destruction of the object

16
01:18.730 --> 01:24.910
the destroy method will be invoked and we put all the cleanup code inside the destroy method and then

17
01:24.910 --> 01:32.830
spring will destroy that object if we are aware of servlets  then you know the init and destroy method in

18
01:32.840 --> 01:33.200
servlet,

19
01:33.250 --> 01:38.620
these are very similar but what you need to remember is that the init method is called after the object

20
01:38.620 --> 01:45.560
is instantiated and all the properties are set on to the object that is all the dependencies are injected.

21
01:45.640 --> 01:52.060
After that the init method is invoked and just before the object is destroyed the destroy method is

22
01:52.300 --> 01:53.930
invoked.

23
01:53.960 --> 02:00.440
You can configure the lifecycle methods in three ways using xml configuration using or implementing

24
02:00.440 --> 02:02.190
some sring interfaces.

25
02:02.530 --> 02:06.420
our bean classes will implement these interfaces and override some methods

26
02:06.650 --> 02:10.790
And finally a simple way by using annotations.

27
02:10.790 --> 02:15.210
You are going to explore all these three handson in the next few lectures.
