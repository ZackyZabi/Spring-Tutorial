The spring  container provides two life cycle methods for every object that it creates.

1
00:05.580 --> 00:08.830
And we can implement these lifecycle methods in our classes.

2
00:09.000 --> 00:14.390
And then the spring container will invoke them the init  method just after the object creation

3
00:14.550 --> 00:20.890
And the destroy method just before the object is cleaned up or destroyed. There are three different

4
00:20.890 --> 00:27.640
ways in which we can configure and use these methods using xml configuration where in on the bean element

5
00:27.650 --> 00:29.880
when we define a bean using the bean element.

6
00:30.100 --> 00:37.240
We use the init method attribute and specify which method in our class needs to be the init method.

7
00:37.480 --> 00:44.550
Similarly destroy-method attribute can be used on the bean element to specify a clean up method.

8
00:44.890 --> 00:50.320
So usually we put all the initialization could be database connections could be connecting to a web

9
00:50.320 --> 00:50.670
service.

10
00:50.680 --> 00:53.040
All that will go into the init method.

11
00:53.370 --> 00:59.620
And the destroy method will have the cleanup code will be closing the connections cleaning up the files

12
00:59.790 --> 01:05.940
etc. so using xml configuration we can use init hyphen method and destroy hypen method

13
01:05.940 --> 01:14.080
The method names can be anything they need not be init and destroy second method is to use annotations.

14
01:14.470 --> 01:17.540
We can use the at postconstruct and predestroy

15
01:17.560 --> 01:21.180
We use these annotations on our classes init and destroy methods

16
01:21.190 --> 01:24.940
again the names need not be the same.

17
01:25.030 --> 01:32.810
The last and final ways to use the spring interfaces namely initialising bean and disposable bean

18
01:32.840 --> 01:38.720
our class will implement these interfaces and override the methods in those interfaces and those

19
01:38.720 --> 01:41.800
methods will become our init and destroy.

20
01:42.230 --> 01:48.470
We have also learned that when we use annotations by default in spring annotations support is disabled

21
01:48.740 --> 01:49.640
to enable it.

22
01:49.730 --> 01:54.010
We use context colon annotation config

23
01:54.200 --> 02:01.610
First configure the context namespace  in your XML configuration and use this one single line which will enable

24
02:01.610 --> 02:02.720
the annotations.
