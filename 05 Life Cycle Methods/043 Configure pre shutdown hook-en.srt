The previous lecture you have successfully configured and seen the init method in action the result

1
00:06.090 --> 00:12.310
object was instantiated the setter methods were invoked and then our init method which is the high method was invoked

2
00:12.330 --> 00:13.990
then we have used the object

3
00:14.160 --> 00:19.540
but at the end the destroy method or the bye method on the patient wasn't invoked.

4
00:19.560 --> 00:25.100
So in this lecture you will see why that is the reason that the bye method was not invoked all though we

5
00:25.110 --> 00:27.290
configured it and the config dot xml 

6
00:27.510 --> 00:31.620
is that the spring container before it shuts down.

7
00:31.620 --> 00:35.130
We need to tell it that it needs to invoke the destroy method

8
00:35.130 --> 00:44.520
we need to configure or register a pre destruction hook or pre shutdown hook.

9
00:44.610 --> 00:48.460
We do that programmatically in our test dot java

10
00:50.350 --> 00:57.020
on the context we need to tell the container or we need to enable a pre destruction hook

11
00:57.130 --> 00:59.670
before the container gets destroyed.

12
00:59.770 --> 01:04.620
We should it should also invoke the destroy methods

13
01:04.660 --> 01:07.220
That is exactly what we are going to tell the container.

14
01:07.300 --> 01:15.970
We do that using the context but the application context class does not have the registration method to configure

15
01:16.030 --> 01:24.370
the pre shutdown hook we need to do it on the abstract application context is a parent class of application

16
01:24.370 --> 01:25.840
context abstract.

17
01:25.840 --> 01:28.540
So you need to abstract at the beginning.

18
01:28.540 --> 01:35.010
hit control one to import that from Spring Framework do a control shift O to organize the imports.

19
01:36.010 --> 01:39.240
Now context dot register.

20
01:39.290 --> 01:40.110
Shut down.

21
01:40.100 --> 01:40.800
Hook.

22
01:40.870 --> 01:47.320
So this is a method that we need to invoke on the abstract application context which tells the spring

23
01:47.320 --> 01:51.630
container that it needs to invoke the destroy methods

24
01:51.710 --> 01:54.610
we are enabling that feature

25
01:54.670 --> 01:55.760
Run the test again.

26
01:57.660 --> 02:03.080
And this time we will see that it goes inside the by method as well.

27
02:03.270 --> 02:08.190
So the setters get invoked after the object creation it goes into the init method

28
02:08.250 --> 02:10.890
We use the object in our program as we need it.

29
02:10.920 --> 02:13.320
In this case we are simply displaying the details.

30
02:13.470 --> 02:16.970
Then it also invokes the destroy method 

31
02:17.670 --> 02:22.820
And from that bye method we are getting this text which sits inside the bye method.
