1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,330
The last and final step is to create a test class access the bean and see it will be in action.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,970
So let's create the best glass or Eclipse or with a new package called spring or it will be our best

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,000
new class best class.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:28,040
But the main matter finish the first step is to create the application context.

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:39,560
Context is equal to new class but ex-model application context Bassett the

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,550
by copying this Bakkies name pasted inside double chords change their door stoop forward slashes

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:08,150
and at the end slash conflict got maximal save it can Daut Get been passed that class or the name in

8
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,230
the conflict or some other B mean is product service

9
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:25,160
and this can be assigned to AB product service interface runtime polymorphism product service is equal

10
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,990
to that it controls one to import the product service control one again to do the type casting because

11
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:42,980
get beyond it and set object the last and final step is product service not multiply and pass to numbers

12
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:52,940
let's say four and five semi-colon control shift to format and we'll see the end to end flow in action

13
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,260
in the next lecture.
