1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,480
The second step is to create or application classes and interfaces which are product service and product

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,690
service impled with one single method called Multiply go to eclipse or to the source main Java and the

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,580
package composite spring spring it will be doing this class Abdur Java.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,770
We don't need it.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:34,400
Right click on the package saying new interface product service is the interface name finish maximize

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:43,650
how one single method that returns an integer int multiply in number one and number two

7
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,660
create a class that will implement this interface right.

8
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,020
Like new class product service in.

9
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,150
Click on the Add button.

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,580
Are the services the interface we want to implement.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,360
Ok finish that block.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,810
And this should return the product of these two numbers here.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,450
Number one stop number two.

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,840
That's it.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,890
So you have created the.

16
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,880
Those are the application interfaces and classes in the next lecture.

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,130
We will start implementing that aspect's.
