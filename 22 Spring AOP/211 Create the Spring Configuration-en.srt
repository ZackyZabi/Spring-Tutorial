1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,160
In this lecture you will create this configuration file and it will be elements to it or the it will

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:15,820
be namespace to it and use that aspect the auto proxy element go to the spring quarter or any other

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,040
project you want and grab one of the configuration files.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,970
Copy the conflict or text someone close it come back to spring.

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,690
It will be rightly consulate's main Java.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,830
Create a new package.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:40,630
Com dot dot dot spring dot spring it will be dot test finish based conflict direct sample inside that

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,680
open the Banfi guard ask someone get it off the beans.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,380
Delete any beans in there.

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:53,060
Maximize we need to add that it will be namespace and a prefix forward.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,860
So copy any one of these here start with.

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm starting with the C schema.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,270
Bastet it will be.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,020
Is the prefix I want to use and the namespace schema slash.

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,810
A or B.

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:17,230
That is the namespace that I need to at the end and grabbing the context.

17
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,170
And the schema file for it.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,810
Enter Bastet changing from schema I-Slash context through schema I-Slash it or.

19
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:38,060
The same namespace we have used here and for that namespace the schema file will be instead of context.

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,400
It Off context.

21
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,740
It will be spring.

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,840
Hyphen it will be not exist.

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:55,180
The so all the elements will be using be only using one element as of now that is from the schema and

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:06,630
that element is a or b is the prefix colon aspect G or proxy that will enable the annotation based

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,390
aspects for us.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,770
So in this lecture we have successfully created a spring configuration file added.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,990
It will be spring it will be named spaces and also use the IT WILL BE aspect the Arto proxy element

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,640
which will enable all the annotation based aspects for us.
