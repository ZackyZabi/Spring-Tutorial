00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:09,210
In this lecture I will interviews you do what it will be is it will be stands for Aspect Oriented Programming.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:15,000
It is the process of applying services or external services such as transaction management or logging

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,190
security etc. to our application process without modifying the cord or methods in those classes.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,630
These external services are also called cross-cutting concerns because they can be applied across the

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,870
Java e web application.

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,490
They could be a padded down layer.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,250
So it a clear and UI layer for example logging whatever is happening in our application logging it to

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,340
a log file can be applied across these layers.

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,890
Transaction management typically is applied at the Soviet Gisli.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,830
So these external services can be just plug them without changing any cord.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,390
That process is called the Aspect Oriented Programming for example.

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:10,310
Here I have a business class called arder Sobeys immobile with two methods in place order and ship ATA

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,380
and the services that could be used by this could be transaction management Doughtery shipped.

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,360
We might want to send out an e-mail.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,040
And also we want to log what are what is happening in our services class in Deuel log file.

16
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,720
All of these services can be simply used true aspect oriented programming.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,570
So without modifying these methods here and the code inside them all these services like transaction

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:45,170
management send email and logging could be used by this Services class.

19
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,350
They can be applied to the services class using Aspect Oriented Programming.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,570
To summarize Aspect Oriented Programming is a process off a plane services typically external services

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,130
to the classes.

22
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,240
In our application without changing the core inside them.
