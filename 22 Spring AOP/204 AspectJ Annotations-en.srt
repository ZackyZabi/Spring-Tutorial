1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,700
In this lecture you are going to learn the important aspects the annotations that you are going to use

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,130
in the next few lectures to create and apply aspects.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,000
The very first annotation is the aspect annotation which will be mocking our class with to make it class

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,670
an aspect.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,040
We use this annotation on the class once we have aspect inside an aspect we'll have multiple methods

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,630
which will be our advisors will mock those advisors with different types of annotations such as ET before

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,760
and after after returning at around and after throwing each of these will provide a special meaning

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:50,470
to our advice or the method in our aspect and before we use this to mock him and that all that mattered

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,910
in that aspect will be applied before a particular business mid-thirties invoked an Paraguay's.

10
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,610
Any method that is modeled with it after that will be applied after it will declare a business mid-thirties

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:11,410
in walked after returning as the name itself says if we mock advise with this particular annotation

12
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,540
then that particular method will be applied just before the matter returns of value.

13
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,770
But we can access that return value inside our advice at our own.

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,920
If you Mocket particular advice with at owned then that advice will be applied before our business matter

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,140
is invoked as well as after our business method is invoked.

16
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,260
It's right around our business method.

17
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:47,650
Finally after throwing as you can guess if our business met throws an exception then this particular

18
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,990
advise will be applied.

19
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,760
Remember these annotations are not applied on our business metrics.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,050
We are playing these annotations on the aspect classis we create and the methods inside them which are

21
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,310
our advisors.
