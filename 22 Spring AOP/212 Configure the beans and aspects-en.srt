1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,390
The next step is to configure our beans and aspects in the building configuration file that is as simple

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,820
as defining the beans in here.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:19,020
Start with the bean name or ID whatever name is equal to product service is the name.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,420
Class is what you do with the natural course because the Taghreed that go to product service impulse

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:36,550
grab the package name come back based it within that double course year dot product service in camel

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,540
case.

7
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,720
We have defined our POJO.

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:52,430
The next step is to define our aspects as well as a bean bean name is equal to logging aspect.

9
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:03,790
Class is equal to go to the logging aspect grab the package name come back to conflict Bastet dot logging

10
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,540
aspect.

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,640
Close it.

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,020
So we're defining all the beans here Springle create the objects of these bins and at runtime it will

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:22,150
use these aspects and apply that advises as we have already configured the wind cuts in here.
