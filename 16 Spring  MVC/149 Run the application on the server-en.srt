1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,610
We are all set to see it in action. Before we do that, in the dispatcher-servlet.xml,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,470
I forgot to add a forward slash at the end of views. So add a forward slash so that when the view

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,600
resolver tries to resolve the view, it will use the following path,

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:29,390
slash hello.jsp. if you don't add this forward slash we'll get an error. So add it. right click on the application,

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,000
go to Run as -> Run on server.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,750
This will deploy the application on the Tomcat server which we have configured in the software setup.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,710
It is stopped right now.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,550
It will automatically start it and deploy

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,540
the Spring MVC application on the server. By default,

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,690
you will see Hello world, because it opens up the index.jsp.

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,010
But that is not we are interested in.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,470
So go to the eclipse browser. You can grab this link and you can open this in Chrome web browser as

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,510
well and you can also configure Eclipse to directly open it in Chrome.

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,190
At the end, the url should be Spring MVC which is the application name. Localhost is the server name,

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,930
8080 is the port number of Tomcat, slash,

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,920
hello.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,470
That is the url which we have configured in the controller.

18
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,520
If you go here,

19
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:30,180
hello. Let's use that, Enter. And Spring runs and you see Hello from Spring

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,360
MVC. This is coming from our hello.jsp page.

21
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,680
So from the browser the request goes to our web application. In the web.xml

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,770
we have configurde the dispatcher-servlet to handle everything that comes to our web application.

23
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:54,550
We have used a forward slash. Thr dispatcher-servlet will take the request and it will dispatch it to the

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,320
hello controller.

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:07,280
Here, this guy and this method because we have matched the url pattern to this particular method. And this

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,030
returns a model and view in which we have configured the view to be hello.

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:20,720
The controller will then invoke the InternalViewResolver and it will give it hello. The view resolver

28
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,970
will append.

29
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:29,030
If you look at the dispatcher-servlet, it will append a prefix, this path and this extension and return

30
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,210
it to the controller.

31
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,810
The controller will take the JSP and execute it and send the response back to the web browser.
