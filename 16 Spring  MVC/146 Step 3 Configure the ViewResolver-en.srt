1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,310
The third step is to configure the view resolver in the Spring configuration file.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,910
It is a Java class. We'll configure it as a bean and it's going to resolve the prefix which is the location

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,150
and the suffix which is the extension for us, for our view. So go to Eclipse.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:26,060
Go to the dispatcher-servlet.xml and start creating a new bean. Bean

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:36,070
class is equal to, it's called the InternalResourceViewResolver. So do a control+shift+t,

6
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,240
InternalResourceViewResolver, select this last one from Spring Framework.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:52,060
Open it up, go all the way up, copy the package name, come back to the dispatcher-servlet. Paste it, dot

8
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,280
go back, grab the class name.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,890
Come back, paste it and we have the complete class name.

10
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,800
Name is equal to, call it whatever you want,

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,680
viewResolver.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,950
Close it and within the bean tag we need to set a couple of properties.

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,420
The first one is prefix and the second property is suffix.

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:27,560
So use the property element, name is equal to prefix. The location will go into the prefix. Within the

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:38,100
property provide a value. And the value, we are going to put our JSP pages under WEB hyphen, its forward slash

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,240
WEB hyphen INF, forward slash VIEWS.

17
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,300
We can call it whatever we want, but I'm going to put it under a folder called views under WEB-INF. Control+shift+f

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:02,130
to format. The second property is the extension. Property name is equal to suffix, using which

19
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,910
we'll provide a value.

20
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,410
And this will be .jsp.

21
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,310
You can use any extension. In this application the

22
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:20,800
extension is going to be .jsp. So the view resolver will use this particular path as the suffix for whatever

23
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,090
view we'll return from the controller and it will append this at the end of the view.
