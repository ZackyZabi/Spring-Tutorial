1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,030
The last and final step is to create the location or the required folder structure and the view under

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,460
it, which is the hello.jsp

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,260
in our case. Go to Eclipse. Under the WEB-INF,

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:21,820
if you open the dispatcher-servlet.xml, we have configured the folder to be WEB-INF/views.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:31,230
So right click on WEB-INF, create a new folder called views, finish.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,640
Right click on the views, say new, JSP file. And the name of this should be

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,100
hello, hello.jsp, Finish.

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,220
Maximize, title is Hello.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,630
And within the body, we'll add a bold tag or h1 so that we can see bigger text, h1 for heading.

10
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:12,160
Welcome to spring MVC or you can say Hello from Spring MVC, save it. And that's it.

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,140
So you have successfully finished the final step which is to create the views folder under WEB-INF and

12
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,830
a page called hello.jsp which is our view page.
