00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,240
Starting this lecture, you will create your Spring MVC application in five simple steps.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,900
Number one, configure the dispatcher servlet in the web.xml, create a spring configuration file

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,690
under the WEB-INF folder. Number three, configure the view resolver.

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,490
You know what a view resolver is. It appends a prefix and suffix to the view we return from the controller.

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,120
Create the controller class is the fourth step.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,830
And also we'll configure it.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,290
And finally we'll create the folder structure and the JSP page under WEB-INF.

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,270
So let's get started by configuring the dispatch servlet.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:52,340
Go to Eclipse. Spring MVC is our project. Open the web.xml. This is where we'll configure over dispatcher

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,170
servlet.

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,180
Change the name to Hello spring

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,930
MVC. That's the display name of this application.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,420
Configure the servlet, servlet

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,400
is the element that we want to use. Servlet name is the first one, let's call it

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,890
dispatcher.

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,910
The second element should be servlet-class.

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,690
We know that it is called dispatcher servlet, but we don't know the package name.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,480
You know what to do.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:36,340
Control+shift+t, search for DispatcherServlet and you'll find it under spring framework.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,740
Select it, grab the class name all the way from the package name, copy, come back to the web.xml,

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,630
paste it.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,160
Remove any unwanted lines.

23
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,600
We have configured this servlet name and its class.

24
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,220
Now we need to configure the mapping for it. servlet-mapping

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,070
is the element. It has elements two child elements,

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,580
servlet-name again.

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,340
Dispatcher, the same name

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,980
what we have used here. And a url-pattern. We can use whatever pattern we want.

29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,010
I'm going to use a forward slash meaning, all the requests that come from the browser to our web application,

30
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:29,730
any request should go to the dispatcher-servlet. We can also use something like .html or .do etc;

31
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,880
But I'm going to use a forward slash. So in this lecture you have successfully configured the dispatcher

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,250
servlet from spring MVC in the web.xml.
