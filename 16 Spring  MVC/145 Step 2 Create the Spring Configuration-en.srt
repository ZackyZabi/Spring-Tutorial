1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,390
The second step is to create a Spring configuration file.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,250
And there is a convention that we need to follow

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,170
when we do that, because we are developing a Spring MVC web application and not a standalone application.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,910
We'll put it under the WEB-INF.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:25,080
So go grab any of the configuration files from the springjdbc or even springorm. Go to src/main/java,

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:36,580
test, copy the config.xml, come back, paste it directly under WEB-INF. Right click and rename

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,460
this. There is a convention we need to follow. The name of this file should be, the name of the servlet, our

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,390
servlet name if you see it

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,530
above, in the web.xml is

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,510
dispatcher.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:57,440
So dispatcher-servlet.xml. By default the dispatcher-servlet will search for a configuration

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,450
file with the following name.

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:05,940
That is, the servlet name hyphen servlet.xml. There is a way to override it which I'll show

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,700
you in lectures later on. But for now always remember that the name of the configuration file should

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,030
have the servlet name hyphen

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,740
servlet.xml. Click OK.

17
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,490
Open the dispatcher-servlet.xml. Maximize.

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:29,170
Get rid of everything inside the beans element. And in the next lecture we'll configure the view resolver

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,470
inside the dispatcher-servlet.xml.
