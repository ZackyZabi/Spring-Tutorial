In this lecture you will learn about the spring beans scopes.

1
00:04.410 --> 00:09.180
The scope is availability of the object in the container in simple words,

2
00:09.180 --> 00:14.910
it is the number of objects created in the container of a particular bean type.

3
00:14.910 --> 00:24.050
There are five possible values Singleton prototype request session and finally global session. Singleton

4
00:24.110 --> 00:28.730
is the default value when we configure a bean in the spring configuration,

5
00:28.730 --> 00:30.400
and we do not provide any scope,

6
00:30.410 --> 00:37.880
by default it is singleton.The spring container if the market a singleton or if we don't specify anything

7
00:37.880 --> 00:46.590
on the bean will create only one object no matter how many times that bean is read and used in our application.

8
00:47.590 --> 00:49.790
The second scope is the prototype scope.

9
00:49.810 --> 00:57.640
If we mark bean as prototype then the container will create different objects of that type.

10
00:57.670 --> 01:06.460
Every time that object is read and used in our application and next is request as the name itself says the

11
01:06.460 --> 01:14.590
request scope is only relevant for spring MVC webapplications, when the request comes in from the end user

12
01:14.660 --> 01:20.890
or from the browser to our web application which is developed using spring spring container will create

13
01:21.130 --> 01:27.430
an object per request per user request next session again.

14
01:27.500 --> 01:32.050
Session is also relevant only for spring MVCweb applications.

15
01:32.180 --> 01:39.560
A session is everything that happens between a user logon and Logout or everything that happens from the

16
01:39.560 --> 01:48.030
time the user first access our website till the time he leaves our website if we mark a bean as

17
01:48.160 --> 01:56.170
session scope scope then the spring container will create only one object for the entire session.

18
01:56.320 --> 02:03.400
If a new user session is created then another object will be instantiated by spring.

19
02:03.430 --> 02:07.680
Last but not the least the global session,

20
02:07.740 --> 02:14.670
this will create if we mark bean as Global's session scoped spring container will create an object

21
02:14.710 --> 02:16.950
per global context.

22
02:16.950 --> 02:19.100
This is used only in spring.

23
02:19.100 --> 02:21.630
MVC Portlet applications.

24
02:24.410 --> 02:28.950
In Portlet applications there can be multiple Portlets across these portlets

25
02:28.950 --> 02:30.420
there will be a global session.

26
02:30.440 --> 02:36.410
global context and Spring container will create only one object for the entire global session

27
02:36.500 --> 02:40.690
across these portlets we will see the first two.

28
02:40.700 --> 02:48.070
That is the singleton and prototype in-action in the next lecture and request and session will be covered.

29
02:48.080 --> 02:54.110
When you create a spring MVC webapplications in sections later on a global session will not be

30
02:54.110 --> 03:00.470
covered as a part of this course because will not creating Portlet applications in this course.
