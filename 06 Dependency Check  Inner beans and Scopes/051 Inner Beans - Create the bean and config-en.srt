00:00.460 --> 00:04.840
In this lecture you will learn how to configure and use inner beans.

1
00:04.860 --> 00:11.240
You will work on a usecase where a employee class has a has a relationship with a address class.

2
00:11.280 --> 00:18.480
Every employee will have an address along with ID and the address will have a house number street and

3
00:18.600 --> 00:19.060
city.

4
00:19.060 --> 00:20.690
We are going to keep it simple.

5
00:21.030 --> 00:22.500
You will create these two classes

6
00:22.530 --> 00:31.080
and then in the spring configuration will configure the address as a inner bean for the employee go to eclipse

7
00:31.980 --> 00:32.650
right click

8
00:32.690 --> 00:46.560
create a new class called employee and the package will be com dot bharath dot springcore dot inner beans

9
00:47.090 --> 00:47.600
finish

10
00:50.200 --> 00:59.200
employee will have private int ID and private address which doesn't exist yet.

11
00:59.860 --> 01:01.360
A d d r e s s

12
01:01.420 --> 01:10.000
address will create it hit control one get eclipse help create class address in the same package

13
01:10.520 --> 01:11.000
Finish

14
01:14.280 --> 01:25.800
address will have a house number private int H  number private string street and private string

15
01:26.360 --> 01:27.150
city.

16
01:27.440 --> 01:31.290
just three fields select them all source

17
01:31.300 --> 01:32.870
Generate getters and setters.

18
01:33.120 --> 01:37.970
Select all OK control shift F to format.

19
01:38.010 --> 01:43.560
Go back to employee do the same generate the getters and  setters right click.

20
01:43.740 --> 01:48.210
You can either go to source here or up at the menu level.

21
01:48.360 --> 01:56.390
Generate getters and setters select all OK and that generates the getters and setters do a control shift F to format save

22
01:56.390 --> 01:57.610
it.

23
01:57.630 --> 02:01.240
The second step is to come up with the configuration file.

24
02:01.380 --> 02:05.490
Copy over the configuration file from any of the earlier lectures.

25
02:05.560 --> 02:06.700
Dependency check.

26
02:06.780 --> 02:08.200
Come back to inner  beans.

27
02:08.490 --> 02:09.110
paste it

28
02:13.500 --> 02:18.180
clean up all the beans and will start with the employee bean.

29
02:18.640 --> 02:21.610
Typically we start with that dependency bean.

30
02:21.610 --> 02:27.440
That is address but in this case we want to use addresses as inner bean for employee.

31
02:27.460 --> 02:29.840
So let's get started with that.

32
02:29.880 --> 02:35.440
Class is equal to employee and it's in the long package.

33
02:35.440 --> 02:38.770
Com dot bharath dot spring core dot inner beans 

34
02:38.770 --> 02:42.020
Copy that package paste it

35
02:42.170 --> 02:42.860
Give it a name.

36
02:42.860 --> 02:45.320
Name is equal to within double quotes.

37
02:45.330 --> 02:54.030
Employee and set the properties using P schema p colon the only field we have is ID and then the address

38
02:54.120 --> 03:00.200
id is equal to 1 2 3 its not mandatory to give it a value but let's give it a value.

39
03:00.330 --> 03:10.070
Next comes property the property name is address and we are going to set that property not by using

40
03:10.070 --> 03:16.560
ref tag but as a in inner bean simply inside the property we use the bean tag one more time

41
03:17.640 --> 03:24.570
class is equal to address and copy the package name from here.

42
03:27.800 --> 03:31.530
paste it right before I address at the class level.

43
03:33.090 --> 03:38.440
And the name for inner bean is optional because we cannot use an inner bean outside anyways so the

44
03:38.440 --> 03:42.800
name is optional we need not provide the name to set the properties.

45
03:42.880 --> 03:44.000
We can use properties.

46
03:44.020 --> 03:52.150
Inside this bean use the property element or simply use P schema at this level P colon the very

47
03:52.150 --> 03:59.740
first field or address is H number house number then the street and the city H number is equal

48
03:59.800 --> 04:15.850
to 700 next P colon Street is equal to Mira Mesa blvd 

49
04:16.100 --> 04:20.100
P colon city is equal to my city San Diego.

50
04:20.170 --> 04:28.120
One of my favorite cities and we can close this bean right here and get rid of this ending tag and we

51
04:28.120 --> 04:30.670
have successfully used a Nested bean.

52
04:30.700 --> 04:37.930
That is a bean as a property for an other bean in the next lecture will create the test will run

53
04:37.940 --> 04:39.970
it end to end and I'll explain further.
