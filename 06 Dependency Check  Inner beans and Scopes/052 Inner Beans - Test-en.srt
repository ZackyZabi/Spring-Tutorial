00:00.140 --> 00:06.630
In this lecture you will finish the last step which is creating a test and see the inner  beans in action.

1
00:06.690 --> 00:11.520
We have started by right clicking on the package say new class let's do it from scratch.

2
00:11.510 --> 00:13.540
It has been a while since we wrote a test 

3
00:13.820 --> 00:22.470
Select the main method finish the very first step is to create the spring container or get access to the

4
00:22.470 --> 00:26.110
spring container we do that using application context.

5
00:26.220 --> 00:35.810
Context is equal to new class path xml application context that takes a configuration file which

6
00:35.820 --> 00:40.720
is the config Dot xml with the entire package.

7
00:40.800 --> 00:48.790
So copy that package name and paste it right before config add a forward slash and change all the dots to

8
00:49.050 --> 00:50.050
forward slashes

9
00:57.370 --> 01:02.640
the spring container and the classpath xml application context will search for this file on the

10
01:02.730 --> 01:03.060
classpath

11
01:03.060 --> 01:09.980
at this path control one import the application context from Spring.

12
01:09.980 --> 01:13.520
Second step is to retrieve the bean from the container.

13
01:13.520 --> 01:21.110
We use the get bean method and pass in the B name which is employee.

14
01:21.440 --> 01:23.380
We haven't added the two string methods,

15
01:23.420 --> 01:31.820
So let's go to employee along with ID and address we need along with the setter and getter methods lets add a

16
01:31.820 --> 01:33.000
two string method.

17
01:33.020 --> 01:36.640
Source generate two string hit.

18
01:36.710 --> 01:37.440
OK.

19
01:37.880 --> 01:39.010
That will do it.

20
01:39.050 --> 01:40.720
Same for address.

21
01:40.820 --> 01:44.400
Source generate 2 string.

22
01:44.640 --> 01:45.830
OK.

23
01:46.400 --> 01:55.140
save It come back to test retrieve the employee and hit control 1 assign statement to a new local variable

24
01:55.290 --> 02:03.190
it returns an object change to employee and change the name to employee as well.

25
02:03.220 --> 02:15.740
control one add down casting two employee from object sysout employee do a control  shift F to format right

26
02:15.900 --> 02:21.410
click run our test.

27
02:21.470 --> 02:22.600
It is an exception.

28
02:22.600 --> 02:29.910
Let's scroll up and see what the error is, error creating bean with employee defined on the classpath 

29
02:29.950 --> 02:31.420
error setting property values.

30
02:31.430 --> 02:36.290
That's not rightable property invalid property address.

31
02:36.490 --> 02:39.940
So we have used the wrong name instead of ADD.

32
02:39.970 --> 02:41.720
We have used AD somewhere.

33
02:41.740 --> 02:45.530
So let's get let's go and see the config file.

34
02:45.880 --> 02:47.360
go to config dot xml.

35
02:47.500 --> 02:54.180
And here the property name should be address and not our adress run the test

36
02:54.200 --> 03:02.340
again and this time it passes and we get the employee object along with the address inside it.

37
03:02.340 --> 03:07.850
So you have successfully configured the inner bean address for the employee.

38
03:07.840 --> 03:13.870
And spring has instantiated the inner bean and it has set it in to the address of the employee.

39
03:13.900 --> 03:15.310
And we got it back.

40
03:15.700 --> 03:22.840
So now you know that there are four ways to inject an object using the reference as element reference

41
03:22.840 --> 03:28.650
as attribute using P schema and also using inner bean.

42
03:28.720 --> 03:37.030
The inner bean can be used only in case of reference types and also only when the bean above or the  dependent bean

43
03:37.100 --> 03:43.160
has a has a relationship with the dependent bean or depende

44
03:43.450 --> 03:49.300
So in this case the employee has a has a relationship with the address only in that case we can use

45
03:49.300 --> 03:50.440
the inner beans.
