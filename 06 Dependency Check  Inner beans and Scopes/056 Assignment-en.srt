As an assignment I want you to create a POJO called University with three fields in it.

1
00:06.210 --> 00:12.480
It's going to represent a university which has an ID and name and the location of the university.

2
00:12.700 --> 00:19.780
First will ensure that the ID field is mandatory using the  at required annotation.

3
00:19.830 --> 00:25.320
And always remember that you need to enable annotation support in the example and you know how to do

4
00:25.320 --> 00:26.610
that by now.

5
00:26.610 --> 00:33.410
And also I want you to use a scope called prototype on this university.

6
00:33.840 --> 00:38.570
So in your test class when you create the test class every time you ask for this university

7
00:38.580 --> 00:43.500
bean spring should create an instance of it it's not a single turn which is the default.

8
00:43.740 --> 00:46.410
But you should be using the prototype scope.
