In this lecture I will summarize what you have learned from that dependency check inner beans and

1
00:06.270 --> 00:14.040
scope's section. Using the spring dependency check feature we can ensure that a particular object for

2
00:14.040 --> 00:16.470
sure gets what it requires,

3
00:16.560 --> 00:19.910
that is the dependencies that it requires in order to function.

4
00:19.950 --> 00:26.850
We do that using the @ required annotation on a particular dependency.

5
00:26.960 --> 00:33.490
If that particular dependency is not provided at runtime Spring will throw a bean initialization exception

6
00:33.950 --> 00:36.820
by default spring will assign the default values.

7
00:36.830 --> 00:42.680
But if you use the at required annotation then that dependency has to be provided otherwise you will see

8
00:42.680 --> 00:45.080
this exception in your application.

9
00:45.860 --> 00:49.100
Second we have learned how to configure beans inside beans.

10
00:49.100 --> 00:50.590
That is dependencies.

11
00:51.120 --> 00:57.520
We use Bean then the property tag and then inside it we can define another bean.

12
00:57.630 --> 01:04.350
So the first bean depends on the second bean inner beans allow us to define dependencies within another

13
01:04.350 --> 01:05.080
bean.

14
01:05.370 --> 01:08.450
We have learnt how to do that and seen it in action as well.

15
01:08.820 --> 01:15.740
Last and very important you have learnt the five different scopes namely Singleton prototype request

16
01:15.750 --> 01:19.750
session and global session that apply to spring beans.

17
01:20.820 --> 01:27.650
Spring container by default uses the singleton scope that is no matter how many times we retrieve and

18
01:27.660 --> 01:34.020
use an object from the spring container in our application it will create only one instance of it to

19
01:34.020 --> 01:34.710
change it.

20
01:34.710 --> 01:38.620
We specify a scope in xml configuration.

21
01:38.670 --> 01:44.940
The second scope that we can provide is prototype which tells the spring container that it should create

22
01:45.000 --> 01:52.020
a different bean everytime we request for an object in our application. The request transition scopes are

23
01:52.020 --> 01:55.710
for the web application context when you work with spring MVC.

24
01:55.740 --> 02:02.040
You can see these two in action and the global session is for portlet context when you develop portlet applications

25
02:02.040 --> 02:05.220
which is  very rare which you use for global session.
