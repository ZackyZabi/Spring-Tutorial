00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,180
In this lecture, you'll work on the next step which is to create a UserController that will return this

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,270
user registration dot jsp to the end user

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,740
when you hit a URL.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,990
So first he needs to access the form and then he can submit the form.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,070
So we are going to do and handle that portion in the Controller. Go to Eclipse, minimize, right click on the

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:37,470
Controller or a Controller package. Say new -> class, UserController, finish. Mark it with the @Controller annotation

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,090
right away before we forget that. @Controller from Spring stereotype.

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:52,240
Next we'll start with one method that returns a ModelAndView. Public ModelAndView from Spring.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,870
showRegistrationPage, a long method name. Within this method we'll create a new

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:14,020
ModelAndView. Hit control+1, assign statement to a new local variable. ModelAndView is fine.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,110
ModelAndView.setViewName.

12
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,120
All we are doing in this method is returning a view.

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,340
The very first view the user should see, which is userReg.jsp.

14
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:36,700
So user, r is capital, reg. And return that ModelAndView object back. Control+d, do the

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,740
RequestMapping. @RequestMapping, within brackets, double quotes,

16
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:55,760
you can use whatever URL you want, say register or registrationPage. So users will access this using

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,120
this particular URI.

18
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,610
This method will be run and we'll return a userReg.jsp.
