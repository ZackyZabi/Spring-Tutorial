00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,460
In the previous lecture, you have seen how to send the data from the Controller back to the UI but

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,190
when we send the response back,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,140
we were sending it back to the same registrationPage once the registration completes successfully.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,520
Instead of that, let's complete the flow end to end. That is, from the UI to the Controller and from

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,660
the Controller to an other new UI.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,150
Go back to the UserController. Instead of sending it to the UserRegistrationPage, we'll send it

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:37,340
to a regResult, r capital, regResult will be our new view which will simply say user registered

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,750
successfully and it will display the model which we are going to set into the ModelAndView.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:52,840
So here into this ModelAndView, stop the Tomcat server. Come back, dot, addObject.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,410
Set the user information again so that we can access it in the next view.

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,830
Double click to minimize, create a new view.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,290
Right click on the view and the view name should be regResult. JSP file,

13
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,540
reg, r capital, result, dot jsp.

14
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,630
The title is User Registration Response

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:41,870
or Result. And within the body, say User Registered Successfully.

16
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,820
User details are, you can display them however you want.

17
00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:00,500
I am going to simply use the JSP expression and say request.getAttribute and the key that we

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:08,420
have used in the Controller is user. So use that key and the toString method will be invoked and it should

19
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:19,070
be displaying the user details. Go to the server, right click, restart or just talk because I have stopped it.

20
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,060
Go back to the browser

21
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,970
within Eclipse or even outside Eclipse. Start the registration,

22
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:33,370
let's say test is the, or 1234 is the id, test is the name, test@gmail.com is the

23
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,250
email id. Hit the submit button.

24
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,330
This time the registration completes and it goes back to the result page. Instead of going back to the

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,550
registrationPage,

26
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,670
now it goes to a new page, the JSP which we have just created. And it displays User Registered Successfully.

27
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,990
User details are and the user object.

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,180
So you have completed the flow end to end. You have used both sending data from the UI to the Controller as

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,710
well as sending data from the Controller to the UI in one single mini application.
