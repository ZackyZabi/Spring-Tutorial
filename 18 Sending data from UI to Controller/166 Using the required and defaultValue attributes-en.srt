1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,230
In the previous lecture, you have successfully read and displayed the query parameters. In this lecture you

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,180
are going to learn two more attributes that we can use inside the @RequestParam.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,700
Go back to the browser, and this time don't provide the salary details.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,610
Get rid of the last parameter, hit enter, submit the form again and let's see what happens.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,110
It says required double parameter salary. You get a HTTP 400 back because by default Spring

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:37,510
container wants everything that we mark with the @RequestParam annotation. To make them optional,

7
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,250
you can add a new attribute. Before you do that,

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,110
you need to assign this sal to a value.

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,500
If its two attributes are more than we have to use value is equal to sal

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,270
comma, required is equal to, within double quotes,

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,740
it's a boolean value.

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,740
So required is equal to false. By default

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,830
it is true.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,270
Now you're going to see an other exception.

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:10,700
So go back to the browser, hit enter without providing salary. Once Tomcat restarts

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,090
let's try that again in the browser and we see a different exception this time.

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,530
Scroll down and it says optional double parameter, it is optional,

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,430
but salary is not present but cannot be translated into null. Because it's a primitive type,

19
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,300
it cannot be translated to null. Spring tries to assign a null value, it doesn't work.

20
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:39,100
So go back to the RequestParam's controller and provide a defaultValue.

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,960
The last attribute is defaultValue,

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,680
v capital is equal to, say 60. 60 is the default salary.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,740
Save it and that should go inside double quotes.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
Restart the server

25
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:09,780
just to make sure our changes are picked. Go back to the browser, hit Enter and this time you don't see any errors.

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,710
And if you see the console, id is 123, name is John

27
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,020
and the salary is the default salary. You can provide zero as well if you want to, any default value.

28
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,350
So in this lecture, you have learnt that you should always mark the fields as optional

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,520
if you don't want them and you should provide default values for primitive types because a null value

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,370
cannot be assigned by the Spring container to the primitive types. You can also try out by passing invalid

31
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:38,820
values.

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,210
For example if you pass in xyz for id you will also see an exception.
