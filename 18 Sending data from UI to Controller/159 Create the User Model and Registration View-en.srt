1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,620
In this lecture, you will start working on the user registration usecase by creating the user model, that

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:15,410
is User.java and userReg.jsp page. Go to Eclipse, go to the source folder,

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,890
right click on it. New -> class and this should go into the dto package.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:33,600
So com.bharath dot, select the dto package under springmvc. The name of the class is User. Finish. And this

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,010
class will have three fields,

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,840
id, name and email that are required for his registration, his Id,

7
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,570
usually we generated it in our application.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:56,590
But for now let the user enter this. Private int id, private String name, private String email, three fields

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,280
id, name and email.

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:07,330
As always select them and generate the getters and setters. Source -> Generate getters and setters. Select all,

11
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,610
and I want them after the email.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,020
OK.

13
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,360
Also generate the toString method.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,080
OK.

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,000
Control+shift+f to format it. And we have the model with the three fields.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:30,870
Next, we are going to create the useReg.jsp which will have the HTML form from which, using

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,250
which the user will submit the user data to the Controller.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:43,780
Let's get started by creating, to create the userReg, go under views, right click, new -> JSP.

19
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:59,250
Call it userReg for registration, dot jsp. Maximize, within body we'll have three input types or four,

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,600
three text fields, text boxes and one submit button.

21
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,420
So get started by using the HTML form. Action will be,

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
addUser or call it registerUser.

23
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,670
This will be the mapping that we'll be using in the Controller later on, registerUser.

24
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,250
And method is equal to post.

25
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:39,540
Within the form first is Id, colon, input type is equal to, text is equal to, we'll come back

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,210
to the name in the second. Close it right

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,540
there. Copy the whole line and paste it three more times.

28
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,530
Second is name,

29
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,860
third is email.

30
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,020
And finally we don't need a label for it.

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:07,870
It's the submit button. Input type is equal to submit, name is equal to register and put all these

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:15,010
three or four fields inside a pre element that will keep them in an order.

33
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,210
Control+x, we'll end that pre right here. Control+shift+f to format.

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,650
So we have successfully created the form.

35
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,800
The names here,

36
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,070
if you remember should exactly match the fields in the model here.

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:42,310
So id, name and email. Id, name and the last field is email. Only then the container will be able to map

38
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,410
these fields into our model

39
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,240
once it creates the user object later on when the request comes in.

40
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,910
So you have successfully created the model and the corresponding JSP page.
