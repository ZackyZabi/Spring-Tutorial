00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,460
In this lecture, I will walk you through this simple user registration usecase that you will be implementing

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,700
in the next few lectures and send that data from the UI to the Controller.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,310
The very first step is to implement a userRegistration.jsp which the enduser will access through

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,690
the Controller.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,840
The Controller will send this view back.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,970
The user will then enter the information and submit the form which will once again go to the Controller

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,240
at which point the Controller will create an instance of the User class that we create.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,720
We create this User class. The Controller will automatically create an object of this User class when

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,010
this form is submitted and it will handover that object, this particular object to the Controller method,

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,550
marked with @ModelAttribute annotation.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,310
So we are going to create a Controller with two methods. The first method will simply return this userReg.jsp.

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,070
The second method is what we'll mark with @ModelAttribute, the parameter will be marked with @ModelAttribute.

13
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,750
It will retrieve the user information and simply display it on the console and send a response back

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,540
to the user.
