1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,180
We have successfully completed our usecase and ready to see the application flow end to end. To test

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:13,770
it, go to Servers, right click, restart the Tomcat server so that everything is reloaded and we

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,470
are clean.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,840
Once it restarts, you can right click on the application, do a Run as -> run on server. Or if you have a browser

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,540
open already,

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,520
simply go there and change the URL.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,830
The URL we should be using is registrationPage.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,680
That is where the flow starts.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,610
First we'll access the registrationPage, go to the browser, at the end paste registrationPage after

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,770
springmvc, p is capital. Enter, now the request goes to the UserController,

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,890
the very first method because that is what is mapped to registrationPage.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:58,010
It returns a userReg as view. The ViewResolver will append the .jsp and the location and

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:07,410
we see the output which is the form, the userReg.jsp. Enter some details, 123,

14
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,990
the name is John.

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,450
Email is john@bob.com.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,180
Now when we hit submit it will again go to the Controller because in the userReg.jsp,

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:29,810
we have mapped it to registerUser. So it will go to the Spring Container first. The Spring will create

18
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,270
a corresponding model object for this form,

19
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:41,850
because we have used the @ModelAttribute. It will come to this method because the registerUser is

20
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,420
mapped to this method it will create a model object called user. Take

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,140
the form fields,

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,680
whatever we are submitting from here, create that object. So hit submit and you will see it in action.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,050
It comes to the Controller, goes to that method, gives it the model object after creating it, taking the form

24
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,750
fields, setting the values which we are displaying on the console here.

25
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,340
And after that, it goes back to the same registrationPage because that is what exactly we are doing

26
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,060
in the Controller. Here we are setting the view as userReg. This is where we are displaying the details on the

27
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,120
console.

28
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,330
So in this lecture, you have successfully finished sending the data from the Controller or from the

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,960
view to the Controller, from the UI to the controller.
