1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,510
In this lecture, you will see the power of Spring Data. Without writing any queries, you will implement two

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,810
finder methods to find the product. To do that,

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:17,900
go to STS, go to the ProductRepository class or interface. To add a finder method, start typing in

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,750
findBy, hit control+space.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,300
And STS will automatically show you all the finder methods you can create. By scanning through

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,640
the product, and for each of these fields here, it automatically shows you the content or the code assistance

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,050
to generate the finder methods.

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:47,010
We want to do a findByName. Select that and automatically the type is String name and the return type is

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,890
a list of products. Its not a single product, because there could be multiple products with the same name.

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,630
If it was an id, then it is unique but not the name. That's it.

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,370
That is all we need to do to get a list of products,

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,420
given a name. We need not write any SQL.

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,300
Now go back to the SpringdatajpaApplicationTests.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,600
Let's comment out this entire code here so that we can just see the custom finder methods in

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:26,370
action. Start commenting out with save and comment out all the way till the end. You can use shortcuts if you're familiar

16
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:43,510
with them. Control+shift+f to format. Add a sysout, control+space, system.out.println(repository.findByName) now it

17
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,650
lists out, along with the inbuilt methods like findAll and findOne,

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,420
we also see findByName, because we have just added it to the repository.

19
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,830
Pass in the name. Name is Mac.

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,820
Saved.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,770
Run the test.

22
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,730
And we should see one product coming back

23
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,480
in the results, and here you go.

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,650
So I got a product back successfully.

25
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,960
So it's that easy to implement custom finder methods. Now to implement a findByPrice, you know how to

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,190
do it.

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,870
Go back to the repository. Again, start typing in findBy, Control+Space, price. Automatically it picks up

28
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,110
what datatype it is,

29
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,960
and also it returns a list of products. Control+shift+f to format. Come back to the test, instead

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,400
of findByName or let it be. Copy it, go to the next line.

31
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:50,610
Paste, findByPrice. Instead of Mac you need to pass in a double.

32
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,480
Remember, we have updated the price.

33
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,680
Don't use 1200. Use 1500d.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,390
Save it.

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,580
Run the program again. This time we should see the same output, twice, because we are doing two finders.

36
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,540
Let's see the results.

37
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,430
There we go. So we have two products coming back, or there is only one product but we are executing

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,570
two finder methods,

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,940
and we are displaying the results.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,540
So in this lecture, you have successfully learnt how to implement a custom finder methods on our repositories

41
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,150
without writing any SQL.
