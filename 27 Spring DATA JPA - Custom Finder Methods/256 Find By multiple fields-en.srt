1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,540
In this lecture, you will learn how to implement a findBy method that takes multiple fields and returns

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,220
a list of products.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,190
It's very simple again. findBy,

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:22,340
I want to search for a product based of its name and price. And this time it takes two parameters,

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:35,260
(String name, Double price) and it should return a list of products. Save it. At the end add

6
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,070
a semi-colon. Do the control+shift+f to format.	That's it.

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,370
So you have successfully used a keyword called And.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,600
And you have come up with a finder method that takes two parameters. You can always refer to the Spring

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,650
documentation, Spring data JPA documentation and it has different keywords that you can use for different

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,890
sql syntax that you want to generate.

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,690
The key words are similar, named similar as the SQL.

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,370
When we come up with our SQL statements, we typically use the same keywords. Go back. To test it, go back

13
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,970
to your test, add one more.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,840
sysout,

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:28,570
repository.findByNameAndPrice. So I need to pass in Mac, which is the name and the price

16
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,170
is, its a double 1500d.

17
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:42,720
Save it, run the program. We should get a total of three products as a result from these three finder

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,430
methods and we see three products coming back.

19
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,610
Now if I change this to 1501 instead of 1500, re-run the test, I should

20
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,490
not be getting any results for the third finder. I should only be getting two results.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,230
The third list should be empty.

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:10,730
So we see two products and the third one is empty because the prize didn't match although the name matched.

23
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,580
Now go ahead and play around with the different keywords that are available in this table.
