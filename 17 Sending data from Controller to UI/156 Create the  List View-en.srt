1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,710
Before we create the displayList.jsp in this lecture, let's set these values on the right objects.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,230
That is, we have created employee2 and 3.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,520
But I haven't changed the setters here.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,580
It should be employee2.setId

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,260
and the name and salary similarly.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Employee3 dot setId, name and salary.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:36,350
Once we have it, go to the views, right click. By now you know what to do. View -> New -> JSP. Call it

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,660
displayList because that is the name we have used in the controller. displayList.jsp, finish.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,090
We need two imports here.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,460
So right on this page directive, go to the end before the percentage, greater than symbol, use an import attribute

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,890
is equal to, within double quotes,

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,970
we need the Employee object.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,370
So go to the Employee.java, grab the package name all the way till dto, come back.

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:13,310
Paste it, dot employee. We are going to use employee and also a java.util.list.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,920
So all the imports should be comma separated within the import, within the double quotes. Go to the body use the

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:31,690
scriptlets, less than symbol, percentage, percentage greater than symbol. Within that request.getAttribute.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,630
And the key is employees.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,100
That is what we have set on the ModelAndView in the ListController, employees.

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,780
That is how we can retrieve it. Come back and this will return a list of employees.

20
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,680
We know that.

21
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:59,500
So we can typecast it into that employees, is equal to, within brackets, list of, within angular brackets,

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,790
Employee. By default,

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,960
this returns an object type.

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,960
We need to typecast it to whatever type. In this case it is list of employees. Use a for-each loop. For

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:25,140
each employee, employee e colon, employees, open the floor bracket, end it, out.println. Use the

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,330
out implicit object, e.getId.

27
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:40,680
Similarly you can copy this, paste it. e.getName, that's enough, two fields, id and name. Do a control+

28
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,130
shift+f to format.

29
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,500
So we have successfully retrieved the employees from the request by invoking the getAttribute,

30
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,820
looping through it and displaying the id and name.

31
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,700
You can right click on the application, say run as -> run on server. That will restart the server. Hit finish.

32
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,780
It asks for restart.

33
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,540
Hit OK.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,720
And the URL that we should be using, if you go to the ListController, it should be

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,820
readList.

36
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,360
So go back to the browser, at the end type in read, l capital, list.

37
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,980
Enter.

38
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,360
And that will display the employee id

39
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,420
and the name for all three employees.
