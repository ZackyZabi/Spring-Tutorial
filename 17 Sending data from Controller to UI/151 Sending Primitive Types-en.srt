1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,220
In this lecture, you will pass data from the controller to the UI page and display it on the UI.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,960
Let's do that by going to the Controller which is the HelloController. Double click to maximize it.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:25,040
And right after setting the view you're going to set the data into the model using ModelAndView dot

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,300
addObject is the method which takes a key and a value.

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,780
The key is string.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,490
Let's set some employee information, employee id, employee name and his salary. Id,

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,920
let's start with primitive types and then you will learn how to do with objects. And the id is 123

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,700
which is of integer type. ModelAndView, let's set his name. addObject,

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:02,870
select the last one, within double quotes name. And the name is Bharath. ModelAndView, the last one which

10
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:13,810
is salary.addObject, select the last one again, double quotes, salary. Let's say 10000 bucks. You

11
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,660
can use whatever type of data you want because the second parameter is an object. Do control+shift+f to

12
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,890
format, delete any unwanted lines and that's it.

13
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,520
So along with the view name we are setting the data.

14
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,740
Now go to hello.jsp to process it.

15
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,070
Get rid of this H1,

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,740
Hello from spring MVC in the body.

17
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,690
We can display the data in two ways.

18
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,810
The first way is using the JSP syntax, the expressions

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,750
or the scriptlets.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:58,040
Within this you can use object obj is equal to request.getAttribute, pass the key.

21
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,470
So whatever we have set in the controller, this ModelAndView, is available in the request.

22
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,090
So we have to say request.getAttribute("id") and that will return object type.

23
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:21,890
We can typecast it to an integer, because we know that it's an integer value, integer.

24
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,140
The second is string. So you can typecast it to string, copy this,

25
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,320
this line here, copy it a couple of times or paste it a couple of times. The second parameter is name and

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,320
the third parameter is salary.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,520
The second one should be typecasted to string.

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,460
The first one is the id. Give them names, name. And the last one is salary.

29
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,640
String, do a control+shift+f to format.

30
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,910
So this is how you retrieve whatever model data you have set into the ModelAndView, that will be available

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,750
on the request object and you can retrieve it and display it. To display it,

32
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:14,500
you can use out.println. Out is the implicit JSP object.

33
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,990
Id, add some text to it.

34
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,260
Id colon, that, copy that line, paste it a couple of times.

35
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:42,390
Second is name. Display the name. Third is salary, display the salary. Save it, control+shift+f. To run the application

36
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:50,840
right click, Run as -> run on server, finish.

37
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,640
This will open the index,jsp but we want to access spring MVC. This is the index.jsp slash,

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,650
if you remember if you go to the controller, the url which we have mapped is hello.

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:12,530
So copy that, come back to the browser within Eclipse. Paste it at the end, remove any double quotes.

40
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,770
Close it, right click, run as -> run on server. Hit

41
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,880
Ok to finish. At the end add a

42
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,930
hello. Enter.

43
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:37,810
It runs and the output is the id, the name and the salary. You can use HTML as well if you want

44
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,400
to and format it a little better.

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,340
So in this lecture, you have successfully sent the data from the controller by setting it on the

46
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,000
ModelAndView as object by using the addObject method and you have retrieved it in the JSP

47
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,580
using the request implicit object dot getAttribute.
