1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,300
So far you have worked with primitive types as well as objects types. You have both types of data from the

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,000
controller to the view. In this

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,300
and the next lecture, you'll learn how to send a list, list of objects. Let's start by creating a Controller.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,160
Copy the ObjectController, paste it on the controller package.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,300
Rename it to ListController, remove the 2 at the end.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,360
Hit OK.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,310
Open the ListController.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,890
Change this from readObject to readList. The method name can be anything.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,820
Change it as well to sendList instead.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,580
The view name will be displayList. From object

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,940
everything changes to list. On the ModelAndView, instead of setting one single object,

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,850
this time we are going to create a new array list of employees.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,270
Create a new array list of employee. Hit control+1, import array list from java.util.

14
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,590
Control+1, assign statement to a new local variable.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:17,540
Call it employee. Copy this entire employee creation and setting of data and paste it couple of times,

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:27,790
employee2 and employee3. Change this from, set employee id to 2, John, you can change to Bharath and his salary

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,420
is 10000. Change the id to 3.

18
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,560
Bob is the third guy and his salary is 7000 dollars.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,670
And this list is a list of employees.

20
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:52,350
So add those three employees to this list, employees dot add employee.

21
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,810
That is the first one.

22
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:08,910
employees.add(employee2) and one more to go. Copy this, paste it, employee 3.

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,670
So we have set all the three employees into the list. Now set

24
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,880
that list into the ModelAndView.

25
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,680
Call it employees. Instead of employee,

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,150
the key should be, give it a meaningful name,

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,220
employees. And this object here should also be employees. Instead of object you are sending an entire list

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,230
back to the view. In the next lecture you will create the view and see it all in action.
