1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,000
So far you have learnt how to send primitive data from the controller to the UI. In this and the

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,180
next lecture, you're going to send object data to the UI using the same addObject method.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,370
So let's get started by creating a new object to hold this data,

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,880
the employee information, the id, the name and the salary.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:29,190
Right click on the java package, new -> class. Call it employee. Instead of controller put it into a package

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:44,250
called dto. Finish, dto for data transfer object. Maximize, private int id, private string name,

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,390
private double salary.

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,770
Let's make salary double.

9
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,240
Select them all, generate the getters and setters.

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,480
I want them, select all, after salary.

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,360
Hit OK.

12
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,250
Control+shift+f to format. Go to source, add the toString method as well.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,430
Hit OK.

14
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,950
And we have the Employee class which we are going to use inside a new Controller class that we are going

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:27,840
to create. Right click on the controller package, new -> class, call it ObjectController because it's going

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:39,160
to return an object. ObjectController with one single method called public, returns a ModelAndView

17
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:50,820
just like our earlier method. sendObject, format it.

18
00:01:51,100 --> 00:02:01,490
And it should return a new ModelAndView. Add a return statement so that the errors will go away.

19
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,600
Select this, control+1, Assign statement to a new local variable. Call it ModelAndView, that's fine.

20
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:21,830
ModelAndView, the very first thing we're going to do is to set a view name. We don't have a view yet. Let's

21
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:32,850
call that view as object. When we create the JSP page, it'll be object.jsp or let's call it displayObject.jsp.

22
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,870
O is capital, we are following camel case convention. The next important piece is to set the model

23
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:50,930
data. To do that, ModelAndView.addObject, key value pairs. Call the key employee.

24
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,160
You can call it whatever you want.

25
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,170
You can call it emp if you want to.

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,710
And the value is a new Employee.

27
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,700
You are going to send an object back. Select that, new Employee.

28
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:12,490
Hit control+1, extract to a local variable. Call it employee. Now assign values to it or set the properties

29
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:23,540
on it. Employee dot setId is 1234, employee dot setName, not the id

30
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,270
again, the name. setName, within double quotes John.

31
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,010
employee dot setSalary, let's say 8000 that's bucks per month.

32
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:50,260
Do a control+shift+f to format. Add a RequestMapping, RequestMapping, map it to a URL or a URI.

33
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,030
Within double quotes, if you go look at the other controller, the HelloController,

34
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:09,370
we use a forward slash and then the URI. Let's say readObject. You can give whatever URL you want here

35
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,430
and that's it.

36
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,530
So in this lecture, you have successfully created a DTO, an object called employee with three fields

37
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,980
and you are returning that from the controller to a view called

38
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,350
displayObject. You will create this view in the next lecture.
