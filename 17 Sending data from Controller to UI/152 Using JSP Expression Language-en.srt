00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:08,020
A second way to process the data inside the JSP page is to use the JSP expression language. It has

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:15,180
nothing to do with Spring or Spring MVC but its a convenient method. So let's use it. To use the JSP

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,110
expression language,

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:24,940
we use the dollar symbol and within flower brackets, open and close brace, simply use the attribute that

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,120
is in the request or session or whichever scope. In this case it is in the request scope.

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,040
And automatically the JSPEL will evaluate it.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,840
That is, it will search in the request scope, get the value of it and it will display its value.

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:46,410
Let's put it inside a bold tag, HTML bold tag. Close the bold tag right there.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:57,920
And this is id colon, copy that line, paste it a couple of times. Do a control+shift+f to format.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:10,800
The second one is name and the third one is salary, colon add a line break right here. br slash.

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,030
So we got Id, name.

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,590
Get rid of the extra id here.

13
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:26,920
Salary, name and then the Id. Save it, go back to the web browser.

14
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,910
But for this to work, there is one thing you need to do. You need to get rid of this doc type HTML

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,810
which Eclipse generates. If you have it here,

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,900
the EL is not going to be evaluated.

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,180
I have seen this issue.

18
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,170
So get rid of this line.

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,130
Go back to the web browser to the Hello, refresh.

20
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:51,250
And we are displaying the details again, but this time it is using the JSP Expression Language which is

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,870
very simple, similar to the Spring Expression Language. Dollar symbol, within floor brackets,

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:05,860
the name of the variable which we have set in to the model, id, name and salary. Automatically the Expression

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,860
Language, the dollar symbol will evaluate this value.

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,240
If we look for this, an attribute with this name in the request scope, get its value and display it to

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,370
the end user.
