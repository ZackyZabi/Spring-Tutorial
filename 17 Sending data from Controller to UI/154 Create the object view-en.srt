1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,360
In this lecture, you'll create the displayObject.jsp which will get the data from the controller and

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,250
it will display that data to the end user. Before we do that,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,530
we need to mark this ObjectController with the @Controller annotation from Spring.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,310
We shouldn't forget that.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:30,800
Go to views, right click, create a new JSP file and the name of it should be displayObject.jsp. Finish.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,430
Let's use a different syntax this time to display the data.

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,920
Title is object details. Within the body,

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:54,270
use a JSP expression, less than symbol, percentage, is equal to, request.getAttribute,

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,460
within double quotes, employee.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,880
That is what we have used in ObjectController, when we set it into the ModelAndView,

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,820
the name is employee and that will be available in the request scope. Control+shift+f to format.

12
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,400
Restart the server because we have been adding several classes. Tomcat automatically loads every time

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,430
we add a class or so, but it's always a good practice to restart it.

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,710
Go to the browser here where it says hello, instead of hello the URL that we should be using

15
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,430
this time,

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,500
if you go to the ObjectController, it is the readObject.

17
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:43,480
So go back to the browser, readObject, enter. It runs and we see the employee information. The Employee

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,130
object comes back, its toString method is being used and the details are displayed.
