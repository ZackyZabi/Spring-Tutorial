Take any web application whether it is Gmail or Facebook or Instagram or any other web application, its

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:15,720
all about exchanging data or information between the end user and the application or the UI and the

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,400
backend application.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,740
Even in Spring MVC world there are two ways to exchange data, from the controller to the UI,

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,280
from the UI to the controller. You are going to explore these two ways in the next few lectures.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:41,660
Let's get started with controller to UI. We send data from the controller to UI using the ModelAndView object.

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:48,650
We set the data into the ModelAndView object by using a method called an addObject, which takes a key

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,270
and value.

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:58,110
The key is of type Java string and the value is of type object, you can set anything as the value.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:06,950
Once you set it and once the request or the response goes back to the UI, we can access it in our JSP pages

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:15,380
or any other UI technology pages using request.getAttribute. Pass the key and you'll get the

12
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,810
value back.

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:27,440
So whatever we add to the ModelAndView is available on the HTTP servlet request object. We can set different

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,750
types of data into it.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,830
This object could be primitive type, object type, collection or whatever you want to set,

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,930
you can set into this and retrieve it in the UI and display it to the end user.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,200
You will explore all these types in the next few lectures.
