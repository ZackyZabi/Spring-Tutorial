1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:07,590
In this lecture, we will use the Service bean inside our test class and see if it got wired properly. Before

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:17,010
we do that, let's move this service to a new subpackage. Create a new package under springboot, dot

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,270
service.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,800
That's where our service belongs.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,190
Move the service there.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,560
OK.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,500
In the test class, I can rename this contextLoads to testService,

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,950
and to get the beans we need to autowire our ApplicationContext context;

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:54,280
mark it with @Autowired. In most of the realtime applications we'll be developing web applications

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,420
and we rarely have to do this.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,520
We use Spring MVC mock test etc; which I'll show you when we do the web development piece using Spring Boot.

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:15,700
Inside the test service, context.getBean(arg0), pass in the class name which is Service.class. Hit control+1,

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:23,070
and import the service class from our own package. Control+1, assign statement to a new local variable.

14
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:32,620
Call it service. service dot, the only method we have in there is save. Invoke that method and that's all

15
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,170
we need to do.

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,120
You can assert for multiple things, but in this case we just want to see the output.

17
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,480
So right click, Run As -> JUnit test.

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,810
And that finishes successfully. As you know if we go here,

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,890
it's all green. And if you go to the console you should be able to see this text called Created.

20
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,320
So copy that, go to the console.

21
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,260
Contro+f, paste that and search for, this is Service Bean Created.

22
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,390
But you search again and you see this text here which says Created which is coming from the Dao.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,820
So all our beans are successfully wired and we see the proper output. In the next lecture,

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,210
I'll explain the flow once again end to end, what exactly is happening,

25
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,520
how are the beans getting wired and how the Springboot application is starting and executing.
