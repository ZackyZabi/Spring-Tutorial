1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,140
In this lecture, you will learn how easy it is to create a spring boot project using the Spring initializer

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,470
web interface. To do that, launch your web browser.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,660
Unlike earlier where we created our projects from Eclipse, this time we are going to do it using your

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,490
web browser and search for spring boot initializr.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,200
There is no 'e'. It is initializr. They have removed e,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,540
just to be cool.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:37,070
Click on the very first link Spring initializr and it takes you to their web page where you can create a

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,170
spring boot Maven project. Generate a maven project.

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,670
We also have a Gradle project option, but we are not going to do that.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,680
We are going to create a maven project with Java.

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,110
Other options are available here,

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:58,610
Groovy, Kotlin. And spring boot, you can select a version. I'm going to stick to 1.5.4 which

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,060
is stable.

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,920
The group id, the maven group id, com.bharath.spring.boot.

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,630
You can give whatever unique group id you want to. And the artifact id is the project name. Springboot will be

16
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,760
my project name. And the dependencies,

17
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,510
it allows you to search for dependencies. If I search for web,

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,780
if you add this you will have the spring MVC support to your project.

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,560
For now I'm going to leave it alone. When we create Spring web projects later on, we'll be using this part.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:43,020
And when you click on the Generate Project, it will generate a Maven project for you with all the pom.xml, source folders, etc;

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,630
It will zip the contents and it will download it into your Downloads folder.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:56,950
So click on Generate Project and as you can see it has created a springboot.zip. Go to your downloads folder.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,570
For me on Mac,

24
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,360
it is Show in Finder.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,680
That will take me to the downloads folder.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,200
I have the springboot.zip. Unzip the contents of it and you will find Maven project with the source

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,010
folder, pom.xml and two other files. In the next lecture,

28
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,690
we'll import this Maven project into Eclipse and will explore the contents of it.
