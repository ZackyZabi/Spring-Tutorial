1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:07,950
In this lecture, I will show you how to create a Spring Boot project by using the STS which is

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,700
Spring Tool Suite. Doubleclick on the Spring Tool Suite icon. That will launch the Spring Tool Suite for you.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,250
Choose a workspace.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,380
It is very similar to Eclipse because it uses Eclipse.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,240
You can select a folder on your machine, click on Launch. And that will take you to the STS homepage

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,510
or the workspace once it launches up. And as you can see it is very similar to Eclipse.

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:45,940
Go to the file menu, say New -> Spring Starter Project. You see that option only in STS, not the regular

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,720
Eclipse.

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,560
So click on Spring Starter Project. And you can change these Maven coordinates if you want to. I'm going

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,170
to leave them as it is. But as you can see it uses the Spring initialiser website to create

11
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,950
a project.

12
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,320
The name is demo, that's fine.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,510
The package is com.example.demo.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,750
Click on next, and here what you have earlier seen as an option for search on the spring initialiser

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,130
website is available for you right here.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,070
If you are creating different types of projects, you can select one of these options like the web and

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,130
those starter dependencies will be included in the pom.xml.

18
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,230
We'll do that later

19
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:34,450
when we create web projects. For now, simply hit the Finish button. That will create a standalone Spring Boot project

20
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,710
for you called demo.

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,700
Expand it and you will see the very similar structure which you have seen when you created this project

22
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,470
using the Spring initialiser earlier. Open up the pom,

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,730
and it should be similar to the pom which you have already seen. Go to the last tab, pom.xml, maximize it

24
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,830
and you will see the starter projects for spring-boot-starter and spring-boot-starter-test.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,010
And at this point you know what to do with this.

26
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,870
You are welcome to create the dao and service again, but that's not required.

27
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,660
It has the DemoApplication which is marked with SpringbootApplication with a main method that is

28
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,920
the starting point.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,580
Then it also has a DemoApplicationTests,

30
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,300
marked with the SpringRunner and the SpringBootTest annotations.
