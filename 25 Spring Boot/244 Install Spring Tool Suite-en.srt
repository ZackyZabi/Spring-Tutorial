00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,910
Out of the four different ways to create a Spring Boot project, you have already learnt how to do it

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,760
using the Spring initializer website and then import that project into your IDE.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,650
In this lecture, you will download an other powerful IDE that allows you to create a Spring Boot project

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,170
right from the IDE

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,880
instead of using or going to the Spring initializer website.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:29,670
It is Spring Tool Suite. This IDE is built over Eclipse.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,290
It internally uses Eclipse.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,540
So it will be exactly same as Eclipse. For Eclipse users,

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,560
it's nothing new.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,060
But in addition, it has a lot of support for Spring projects.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,890
You can also use intelliJ. If you are already using intelliJ,

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,410
you can create Spring Boot projects right from your IDE. To install Spring Boot, launch your web browser,

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:03,970
open a new tab and search for spring tool suite. spring tool suite, select that and you will go to the

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:12,500
spring tool suite search results. Click on the very first link, and download the version for your particular

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,920
machine. That will be a zip file. Once you download it, unzip the contents and you will see something

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,050
like this.

17
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:28,490
For Mac, you will see STS.app. For Windows it will be an exe and you will be all set to create

18
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,880
projects from your IDE. In the next lecture,

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,910
I will show you how to create a project using Spring Tool Suite.
