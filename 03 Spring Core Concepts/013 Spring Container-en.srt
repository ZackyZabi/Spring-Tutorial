00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,470
In this lecture, you will learn what a spring container is.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,770
A container is a predefined program or component that comes with the Spring Framework and it is responsible

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:19,400
for creating the objects holding them in memory and also injecting them into another object as required

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:26,430
so it maintains the complete lifecycle of an object from creation to destruction.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,370
The container needs two things.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,080
The first thing is the bean or the Java classes in our application for which we need objects to be created.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,430
Second an xml configuration which we as developers will create through which we tell the container

8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,900
what the dependencies are for a particular object and it creates an object it needs to know what that object

9
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,110
depends on.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,970
That information is provided in the xml configuration. The container will take these two and

11
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,830
create all the objects and maintain their lifecycle for us.

12
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:09,490
And our application code can then get these objects from the container by requesting for them. The application

13
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,320
context interface from Spring represents a container.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,220
It is an interface we cannot create instances of it.

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:24,010
And the implementations of this interface are class path xml application context annotation configuration

16
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,850
application context and file system XML application context.

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,000
The classpath xml application context will search for the xml configuration on the Java class

18
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:43,060
path. The file system xml application context as the name itself says it will search for the xml configuration

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,860
file on the file system instead of the Java classpath.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,910
Finally the annotation configure application context is used when we configure the beans using annotations

21
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,950
In the next few lectures,

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,980
once you start working on handson you will be using the class path application context.
