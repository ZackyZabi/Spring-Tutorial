In this lecture, I will quickly summarize what dependency injection is and you will learn the two different

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,540
types of dependency injection the spring container supports. Dependency injection is a process of

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,910
injecting what an object requires at runtime dynamically and the spring container does it for us.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,240
Here is an example where we have Employee class and address the Employee class depends on two fields

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:35,340
ID name or three fields ID name and an address. Address is a class of its own it has four fields street,

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,210
city, state and country.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,680
So at runtime the spring container will create the Address object.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,810
It will set all these fields or inject all these dependencies street city state and country then it

9
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:55,590
will create the employee with ID name it will inject these two and it will also inject the Address object

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,700
that it has created into the Employee object so we can do it in two ways spring container allows us to do

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,590
that in two ways using setter injection.

12
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,420
Setter injection is where we provide the getter and setter methods for the fields on our object and

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,420
spring container will create those dependencies.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,100
For example street city state country.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,450
And then it will use the set methods on that object to set of values for them.

16
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,640
So it will create the address create the street city state country.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,870
It will invoke the setter methods to create the address object,

18
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:38,260
It will then invoke the set Id set name on the Employee object that it creates.

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,630
And finally it will invoke the set address and uses the address object to set it into the Employee object.

20
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,100
This is called sector injection or property injection, this is called setter injection because spring container

21
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,160
uses the setter methods on that object.

22
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,120
The second way is the constructor injection.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,930
This is where we provide parametrized constructor instead of setter methods and spring will invoke that

24
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,820
constructor at runtime when it creates an object for creation of address.

25
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,180
It will provide all these dependencies street city state country and invokes the appropriate constructor

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,880
and then it invokes the constructor on the employee by providing these dependencies.

27
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,980
And finally it provides the address object which it was created.

28
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,500
So the two different ways to do dependency injection in spring container or in spring is setter

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,200
injection,

30
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,760
We use the setter methods or the container uses the setter methods that we provide constructor's injection

31
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:49,360
where the container uses the constructor's parameterised constructor's that we provide to inject the dependencies.
