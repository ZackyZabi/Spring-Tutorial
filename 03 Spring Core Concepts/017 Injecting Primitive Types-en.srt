00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,870
The primitive type dependencies can be injected using constructor injection or setter injection and

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,990
using the value tag.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,310
Here I have a class called product which needs or which has a dependency called ID which is of type integer

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:22,830
we are injecting it using the property element that is through setter injection and using the value

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,120
tag we are providing a value to it.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,650
The value can be used as an xml element.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,740
It can also be used as an attribute instead of defining a separate element here on the property element.

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,340
We can use a attribute called value and assign this value to it. A third and compact way of

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:50,650
assigning or injecting primitive types is using p schema or P namespace with very few lines of xml will

10
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,210
be able to inject values using P schema.

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,530
Right on this bean element we use the P schema attributes you we will learn all these three ways and work

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,600
on them in the next few lectures.
