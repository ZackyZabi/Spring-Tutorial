1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,400
When the spring container creates an object and does the dependency injection for that particular object

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,350
it does it based on the types of data,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,400
that object depends on. Based on it,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,180
there are three types of data or dependencies.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:23,920
Number one is primitive type dependencies an object might have primitive type fields and dependencies, spring will consider

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:31,160
all the following types java types by short int long float double boolean character and string as primitive

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,000
type dependencies.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,470
That is the first step.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,290
The second type is the collection type as soon as I say a collection type,

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,980
you know that Spring will consider list set map and properties as the collection type dependencies.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,630
It knows how to create those objects and inject them into the objects as required.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,460
Last but not the least reference types or the object types.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,440
This is the most used type in any java application, this is where a class depends not on a primitive type

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,770
not on a collection.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:13,190
But it depends on an other class object spring will create an object of that type class type and it will inject it

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,770
into the class that depends on it.

17
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,370
So is the reference type.

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,840
The three types of data or dependencies are new types collection types and a reference type you will

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,250
be working on all these three as soon as you start working on the handson lectures.
