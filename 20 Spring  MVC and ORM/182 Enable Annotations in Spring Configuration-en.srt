1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,780
We have used annotations everywhere in our project.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,910
But we haven't enabled them in their dispatcher so servlet dart example to do that.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,930
Go to the dispatcher.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,030
Let go up top right here right after the bean starting element.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:25,090
You know how to do it using text call and component scan and the base package.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,950
In this case we have our POJO classes spread across the different packages for the different layers.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:40,610
So we need to pick a base package which could be putting NBC Autum up to that or even user because controller

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,930
Dow Dow temple and services they are all sub packages off the user which is already you scarce or right

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,300
click on any one of the packages.

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,300
Autorefractor rename say that is better so that's fine.

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,780
Grab it up to the user handsel

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,440
come back to the dispatcher servlet paste that package up to the user and you can close this context

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,300
component's can right there.

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,000
Contradictive to format.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,220
So this spring that you should scan all the back pages of this particular package.

16
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,580
This package as well as its sub package is.
