1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,100
This lecture I will walk you through the simple steps that you are going to follow in the next few lectures

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,560
to implement the user registration use case.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,930
By then they will cease paying NBC and autumn inaction and doing the first step is to create them even

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:22,150
project in Eclipse and update the bomb dot ex-model with the dependencies.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,030
Secondly will configure the front controller or the dispatcher solve for our MVC application by creating

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,140
it.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,930
Bob Daut accessible we are going to reuse several components from earlier projects like Labrada example

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,710
and even spring configuration.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,440
Third step is to come up with this bring configuration file with them which will configure the autumn

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,260
stuff starting with Hibernate template which needs session factory data source and finally the view

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,410
resolver for spring MVC.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,420
So all in one configuration file.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,940
Last but not least we will code and we get to the coding portion.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,240
I'll explain the steps in detail but at the high level it will create the middle class create the data

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,480
access layer which will use the hibernate template.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,640
Then a new layer will be introducing a new layer and a set of interface and classes.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,580
So is this layer.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,470
And finally the controller layer or the UI layer so will do all this in the next few lectures.
