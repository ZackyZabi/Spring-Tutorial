1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
In this lecture will implement the controller matters so that our application will be wired and ready

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,590
to go and do and go to eclipse go to use the controller.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,620
We're going to get some help from the earlier project which is putting MVC because we have already implemented

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,380
the very same methods in the use of controller in that project or do the controller package in spring

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,630
MVC open that controller grabbed these two methods we are going to modify one of them copy them come

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,920
back to the new controller.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,920
Those methods are shift to format and closed the controller so that will not modify that accidentally.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:50,270
Maximize delete this model object from the old project control the control one on the user imported

9
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,130
from our new package in the new project.

10
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,610
The very first method in the controller is going to return the registration page to the end user when

11
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,430
he accesses.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,600
There you are.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,990
If we lose the registration page in the water and we'll send him a page called use the range which will

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,040
have the DML form.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,480
So copy that use the range from the earlier project as sarcy webapp.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,970
We have been for views use the range dark speak copy that close this project can put the new ones being

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,630
NBC Warham or SIRC webapp that Benford.

18
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,720
But this time it's going to be Diest piece because if you open the dispatcher so that we can figure

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,950
out the resolver with the prefix Verband of slash GSB.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,000
So right click on have been new for the GSB for the finish.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,820
Paste the DSP that you have copied which is use the range got TSB which has the form and this submit

22
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,200
this gets submitted to the register user and in the controller we have a matter mapped to registered

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:13,110
user or register user which basically immortal attributes being container automatically takes the form

24
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,560
data that comes in puts it into this object because we have marked it with a model attribute annotation

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,960
and we also use a model map to send the user data back to the UI.

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,340
But this time we are not going to send the end user data only saying that they return value from that

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,180
create method.

28
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,060
So get rid of these first two lines.

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,600
We had lots of changes to his rage result in a second.

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:51,090
For now for us we are going to call the service dark save the matter on the service.

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,660
So whatever he has that information comes in we are taking that and passing it to the service manager

32
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,510
control one.

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:07,390
And this guy returns the end result back big that result and create a string

34
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:27,240
or create than dot and attribute result and the value will be user created with 80 plus pass the result

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,280
back whatever Hibernate is returning us back.

36
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:37,080
The idea that we are sending a message to you why and instead of using a new UI we're going to send

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:45,620
it back to the same user rage page and we will display this message below the file will do that change

38
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,150
in the way in the next lecture.

39
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,980
In this lecture we have successfully implemented the controller matters to show the initial UI which

40
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,340
has the history of form.

41
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:02,280
And when the user submits it it comes to this particular matter where we are taking the model saving

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,880
it to the database and then setting a result on the model which goes back to the UI using model map.

43
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,560
Inside that we have a message along with the result that comes back from the same operation.
