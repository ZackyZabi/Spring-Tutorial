00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,390
In this lecture we'll grab the viewer resolver from our spring NBC project and we'll wire up inside

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,330
our new dispatch of solar dart.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:16,740
I'm all for spring NBC Wadham project expand the spring MBC project go to the dispatcher so Legarda

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:24,620
ex-model and grab this bean which is the view resolver been copied come back to the new dispatcher.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,620
So let go all the way to the end.

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,640
Bastet control shift the format.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,650
And you know how the internal resource the resolver works.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,330
This is the class from spring which is also the complete view name given due just have you name it.

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,780
It is all the complete pop and extension.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,630
So here we can figure out the prefix which is the location.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,350
Insert off using views.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,710
Let's change it to just piece this time just for a difference.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,450
This piece and the extension is still going to be d'arte just be we we're going to leave that alone.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,030
So this if you resolver will append or prefix whatever view we get from the controller with this and

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,340
it'll suffix it with Dot.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:11,750
Just.
