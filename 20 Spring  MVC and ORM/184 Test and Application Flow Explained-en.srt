1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,630
Before we see our application end to end in this lecture one small change of a dark example opened up

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:17,790
our product someone and up top here you see a dot by DTD which inconsistently causes problems with days.

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:24,120
If we have it here the wrong then the DSP expression of language won't work either we need to upgrade

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,950
it to the latest So let version or completely get rid of it.

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,790
So I'm going to delete it for now and have the app element that's it.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,300
Ready to run that allegation right click on the index start GSB or on the project as add on.

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,720
So it finished to start the.

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,640
That will apply the application and launch it in the browser of Eclipse copy that link.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,090
Let's use Chrome or any of your favorite browsers.

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,790
Paste the link and we'll go to the index dot GSP.

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,790
Go back to eclipse go to use our controller grab the registration page you are-I come back.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,690
Delete this in Nexstar DSP paste registration page that is the right answer.

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:26,090
Registration page that will take us through the registration page with three fields and the form entered

14
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,340
an ID lets say 7 8 9.

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:38,710
Name is parrot and email is best at best dot com hit the submit button when we hit the submit button.

16
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:47,640
That request goes to the controller and we see an ID coming back with 7 8 9 with a database to ensure

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
that the data is really saved.

18
00:01:50,660 --> 00:02:01,470
Execute select start from user execute and we do have an ID 7 8 9 user is part and his email is test

19
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,160
that test dot com so the control went to the controller to start with the user controller

20
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,430
and it displayed the user registration page.

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,090
Then we have entered the details.

22
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,440
Hit the submit button.

23
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,710
Then the request came with the second method because this is the action in the form.

24
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,980
Spring automatically converts the incoming form data into a model object because we have McBeth using

25
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,190
Mardell attribute.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,090
We have taken that model object past it to the service the service done.

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:43,210
In walks the matter and the document uses hibernate template to save it to the database and it returns

28
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:49,030
the result back which is the ID which we have passed in that ID comes back as the result goes back to

29
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,660
the controller in the controller.

30
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,240
We are taking the ID setting it into the model map which we are creating and sending the result back

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,710
saying user created it id and we are pushing the portal back to the same registration page which is

32
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,940
being displayed here along with the reason.
