1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,400
In this lecture area will work on the PERDER an important step which is to create the spring configuration

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,870
file and Wajir the hibernate template beans as well as the way you resolve our beans in it.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,610
You have already done these two separately when we were on spring putting autumn and spring.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,620
And we see.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,080
So let's get started by going to eclipse the naming convention we need to follow is the name of ourselves

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,940
left in the dark which is.

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:36,520
Dispatcher fun so that dot Exxon-Mobile the dispatcher so will search for a file with that name on the

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,540
classpath.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,140
So let's reuse some of our earlier configuration.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,870
Go to the spring.

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,670
Autumn all the way to product or best package.

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:54,950
Copy this conflict got Exxon-Mobile come back to our spring NBC autumn go to the web that actually been.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:07,300
Bastet reichlich rename it to dispatcher hyphen Soldat example this Patcha hyphen.

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,630
So let dot Exxon-Mobile hit.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:18,440
OK open that dispatcher Let need this context confidence can we'll come back to it and give it the right

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,530
packages.

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,670
Were already aware of all these beans you know configure them and you worked on spitting autumn hibernate

18
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,490
template is what we are going to use inside our doll class when we create it.

19
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:38,160
We had to of this high but the template and that template depends on session factory and the session

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,600
factories the local Sishen factory being from spring.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,560
It needs a data source which is configured up here which takes a class name of the driver that you want

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,100
to connect to the database the user name and password.

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:59,130
And also there are couple more properties the hibernate properties where we give with the ballot form

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,960
as well in my case this class is responsible for generating the sequel queries and this flag through

25
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:13,670
here through hibernate choice Google tells hibernate that it will display all the queries that it creates.

26
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,820
Finally we have annotated classes property configured for decision factory is where we configure or

27
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,690
tell hibernate about all over entities are Mardell classes.

28
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,890
We'll come back to this configuration later on and we'll change these back names.

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,170
We'll fix them once we create those classes in the next lecture.

30
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,240
We will configure the view resolver.
