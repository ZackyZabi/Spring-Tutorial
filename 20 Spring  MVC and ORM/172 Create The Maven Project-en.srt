1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,460
In this lecture he will walk on the very first step which is to create them him project and update the

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:15,550
bomb dot example or to eclipse Filemon you knew Mavin project you had to create it may have an application

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:24,700
next door and select the default option scroll down and go to May an archetype that Python webapp next

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:34,710
with a name call it putting MVC or R M and B C for a model view controller or item for object relational

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,360
mapping inish.

6
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,480
And that will create a new project for us.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,680
The very first step is to get rid of this error.

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,040
You know why that happens.

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,670
It's because of this dependency is already already done it.

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:58,560
When you work on the spring MBC project right click go to properties search for run times click on target

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,270
at run times and Apache Tomcat.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,300
OK that will resolve that error.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:12,780
Next open the Bombarnac someone and let's update it by adding someone figuration from the previous projects.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:24,880
Go to the spring MBC project open up the palm file click on the last tab about a click to maximize.

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,950
You can copy starting from properties all the way till end of burled copy that come back but the new

16
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,830
project start from dependencies.

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,950
Go to the end of it and paste what you have copied to the Control shift.

18
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,410
If you format we that may have an compiler plugin as well as we have the spring.

19
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,650
MBC dependency.

20
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,420
We also need the spring autumn dependencies.

21
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,590
So go to the autumn project spring

22
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,620
autumn expanded open the bombard X-amount

23
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,330
lofts tab again and maximize it.

24
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:16,930
All we need is the spring autumn hibernate core and my squirrel character copied those three dependencies.

25
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,020
The spring quarter and spring context we get it for free when we add the spring.

26
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,820
Bambi MBC.

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,150
We have successfully added all the dependencies.

28
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,780
The first one is putting in.

29
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,300
You know why we need it to work on the UI layer.

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,880
We need to bring MBC trans pulls all the other dependencies.

31
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,270
It requires spring.

32
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,260
Autumn of course to use Hibernate.

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,860
Hibernate template hibernate core has all the hibernate core and a squirrel character.

34
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,570
This is the driver profile file JTB see Driver Josephite right click on the project go to may even do

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:56,950
it.

36
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:04,020
Update Project hit OK and maven will resolve everything and we don't see errors anymore.

37
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,280
So he have successfully completed the very first step.
