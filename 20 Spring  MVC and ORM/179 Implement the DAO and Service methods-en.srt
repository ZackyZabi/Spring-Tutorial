1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,120
From this lecture we will start creating them methods across these layers starting with the Dow.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,350
Leah the services are the matters in the Data Access Layer are used by the services.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,730
Let's do that.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:20,020
In this lecture and we'll start working on the controller layer in the next one or two clips what would

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,340
they use or Tao.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,600
And had a method called inte introduced in Dejah create.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,880
Text that use the model object user

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,780
and they use the registration happens when we want to save the record database.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,780
This is the method that should be invoked.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,860
Now where we use our Dalrymple it control one wherever we see read and implemented amateur's or to create

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
matter control.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,480
We have already implemented this method in project early and out hibernate template d'arte save and

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,740
pass the entity to it.

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,980
And it returns a signed statement to a new local variable returns a serializable object which is in

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:20,280
picture type cast to be Carlat result and return that result back all in one single line.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,000
So we have successfully implemented the Create Mathare.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:31,250
Now go to the services class which is user we sit in or he has a service implement or create them at

18
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,540
their altimeter which unsane Dejah you can call it create or you can call it save or anything you want.

19
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:49,550
It need not be the same name as the method in their the user user on one import user or on package or

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,280
their service impulse control one and an unimplemented methods.

21
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,810
Here we are going to use the Dow.

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:07,890
So insert them at 38 or Daut create pass the user and you can add the write down statement here.

23
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,270
Get rid of this written control.

24
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,580
Delete the record.

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,940
So what are the always running these classes are these methods that are running back.

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,610
In addition we can house some business logic here.

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,300
I will show you some examples later on.

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,950
And this meant there can be market with it transactional annotation from spring we haven't been able

29
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,640
annotations in our configuration will do that but we can mark this method with transactional instead

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,360
of mocking the method.

31
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,060
We can also have a transactional here but it's always a good practice to have it.

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,780
So we just layer because we can how multiple database statements that might be executed from within

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,320
here.

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,100
And we want all that to be in one single transaction.
