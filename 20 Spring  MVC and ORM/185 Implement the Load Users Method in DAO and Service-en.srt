1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,970
In this lecture you will implement the methods in the Dow and the services which will load all the users

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,930
in the user table and display them on the UI.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,240
We'll start with that here then the services layer and then we'll implement the controller and view

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,520
in the next lecture.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:27,370
Go to the user now add a new method that returns a list of users call it find use this

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,590
import less hit Control run imported from Jacquard.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,210
It'll go to the user.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:43,790
Impulse control one at unimplemented amateur's delayed that to stop the Tom-Kat if it's running otherwise

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,300
it's going to keep reloading the context.

10
00:00:49,610 --> 00:01:00,950
Was that a impulse to find the users we remember the operation on the hibernate template hibernate template.

11
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,170
Dark Lord all is the matter and we need to tell it.

12
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,800
What is the A.P. class.

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,900
In our case it is user dot plus.

14
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,560
And that will automatically return a list of users assigned to a new local variable.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,640
We can either do that or simply add a written statement here.

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:33,280
Delete this written null and that matter will return a list of users back to the Soviet laya users so

17
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,290
we start Java do the same here.

18
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,050
List of users.

19
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,820
And you can follow this method get users.

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,110
It need not be the same name as the Dow.

21
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:55,100
It's up to us to design our business logic methods control one import the list go to use so we simple

22
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:08,350
control one are unimplemented amateur's and the return dao not find users that set a single line.

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,700
So in this lecture we have successfully implemented the load user's method so that we can get all the

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,020
users in the database into a list of users in the dark layer or the data layer.

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,470
And so we said earlier in the next few lectures we will implement the controller and the methods.
