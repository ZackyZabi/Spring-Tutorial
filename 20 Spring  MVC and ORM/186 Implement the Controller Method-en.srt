1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,180
In this lecture you will implement the controller.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,110
After that we'll use to use a service load the users from the database and send it back to the view.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,780
It will send that list back with The View will create the view in the next lecture.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:21,300
Go to use a controller copy the very first method which users get by default.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:30,060
Bastet Lord you can call it the users are get users is the matter also change that you are pattern to

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,650
get users

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:49,470
get to use this method we'll call the service Daut get users which returns a list assignable local variable.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,580
And we need a model map so that we can send this list back to the UI.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:04,970
So in the matter parameter we need to define a border map order so that will go back to the UI into

10
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:13,750
the model map model dot and attribute the last one the string.

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:20,600
The key will be users and the value will be the users which is the list here.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,530
So we are going to send that list back to the UI and return it to a page call display users which will

13
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,640
create in the next lecture display users.
