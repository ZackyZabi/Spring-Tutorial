1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,240
The second step is to update the web dot ECOMIL file by adding dispatcher.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:14,130
So let's go back to Eclipse and that's spring NBC or go to a sarcy mean webapp web.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,980
Enough have been put on the Web got a sample file right now.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,900
It has very few elements in here.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:32,150
Open up the spring MVC project go to as SEE main webapp Labrinth Labrador sambal.

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:37,700
You are welcome to copy paste everything or you can start typing.

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,650
I suggest you do it at least one more time so that you remember what goes into the library.

8
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,590
Select is the first element.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:55,730
Give it the names of let my fun name is DISPATCHER You can do whatever name you want.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,300
Next is selve left and class.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,230
You can search for the dispatcher select by hitting control shift key or go to disrupt R-TX symbol and

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,190
drop this name along with the package name.

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,170
Ambac Bastet.

14
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,010
Save it next is the select mapping cell.

15
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,440
Let mapping copy the cell name from here.

16
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,250
And the second element is.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,330
I'll let you waddle pattern one forward slash just like how we have use of the word pattern.

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,030
You can also use other water patterns like Slash MBC if you want to but then we'll have to include that

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,500
in Alaba requests that we want to go through the dispatcher so late.

20
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,350
So in this Lechter you have successfully finished the second step which is to configure the dispatcher

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,100
servlet.
