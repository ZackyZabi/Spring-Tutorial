1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,980
This lecture you will create the display users start a GSB and use JFT or tags Jervoise and the tag

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,600
label inside it to display the list of users to do that.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,710
Before you create the speed there are a couple of steps we need to do to protect someone or three steps

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,930
in the product simle we have removed the DTD on the root element earlier.

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,030
Let's add the proper root element from the resources section of this lecture.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,150
You can download this.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,560
D.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,520
D a lot.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,950
B XTi.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,520
Once you download it from the resource section the very first step is to grab this root element which

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,200
is webapp.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Copy it will back to Bartik someone select this webapp that have an app.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,210
Paste the new element so that we have the root element with the three dot or name off.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,180
So let it be.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,840
Second step is to add the Mabon dependencies.

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,800
So grab these two dependencies SPL and standard tag libraries.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,120
I cover a lot more details on tag libraries.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,360
In my case be sublets and database of course but it's this much knowledge is enough to work on it.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,380
You need these dependencies in the palm up open it with the dependency section all the way to the end

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,360
based on new dependencies.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,720
Control shift to format and Mebane will pull those dependencies for us.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,390
The very first time now we are ready to create the DSP goto source webapp.

23
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:45,400
This piece right click new DSP and the name of the file should be display.

24
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,360
Users Dorte GSB

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,200
to use the Taggett we need to include the tag Libert data too.

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,960
You can copy this last piece from here pasted right next to the very first line which is the page Darick

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,690
to.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,690
This is the tag lib namespace and this is the prefix for it.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,670
Now we can start using the bag liberally inside our DML page to display all the users are the result

30
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,270
that comes back to do that.

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,190
Use C colon for each.

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,230
These are the core tags.

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,190
C stands for core and these are the core tags in the SDL which we can use to display the object data

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,770
inside the display page without writing job or code Seacole and for each

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,200
items is that rebute is equal to within double quotes.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,010
Use the expression language of DSP Dala within our brackets.

37
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,750
The name of the variable inside the user control or whatever we have set into the model.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:59,140
Go back to the controller we have set it as users so retrieve that list go back to the display use or

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,050
start DSP users automatically.

40
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,090
This tag will pull users from the request using request or get a reboot and it will loop through it.

41
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:20,890
We can assign each user in this list where variable is equal to within double court user.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,010
So this object will carry each user in this list inside the loop.

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:39,020
We can get that data using the expression language I can simply see Colon.

44
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,160
We don't have to do that simply use the expression language dollar symbol within flower brackets.

45
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,770
Use that is the bean thought I'd be.

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,690
Similarly we can get name and salary well formatted better Letran name and the last one is e-mail.

47
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:04,350
Let's check the B names by going to use a dot Java ID name an email in the display.

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,620
That's not GSB we are moving through the list of users that comes back in the model and taking the each

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,830
user object in the list and displaying their details.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,850
We'll run this program in the next lecture and we'll format it better.
