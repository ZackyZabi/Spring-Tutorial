00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,920
In this lecture I will walk you through the simple coding steps that you will be following in the next

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,560
few lectures to create our application.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,120
The very first step is to create a moral class called user that represents that database table will

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,020
mark this moral class with the hibernate annotations the JPA annotations to make it entity so that Hibernate

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,980
can stick to the database and read it back from the database.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,890
Next we'll start courting our players for the application starting with data access layer.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,670
So we just layer and then that controller the data access layer will how that user doll which is an

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,270
interface implemented by user impulse.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,180
You already know this pattern you use it in spring JTB Z as of last spring or autumn it uses the hibernate

10
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:57,770
template to perform the database work using the model class that we create next to the services layer

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,820
typically holds the business logic will create a user service and use a service impellor which implements

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,280
that interface and it uses the user are dull.

13
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,580
Finally the controller class will use the services provided the methods provided by the user service.

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,800
So each layer here depends on our users.

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:26,300
The other layer they have it has a relationship and within the layer they have an easy relationship

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:34,350
has an easy let's get started in the next lecture by creating all the classes and interfaces for these

17
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,730
layers across these layers.

18
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,520
First we'll carry the mordent then in the next few letters we will create all the classes and then we'll

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,860
implement the methods.
