1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,220
In this lecture you will start implementing the interfaces and classes across the layers of our application.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,980
Starting with the user interface in the data access layer will only create the interfaces classes and

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,970
Arto out of them.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,070
And in the next few lectures we'll implement the methods across these layers or do Eclipse.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,380
Right click on the source for the new interface.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,410
Start with User B.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,080
All the packets should be user Daut deal finish.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,150
It was that Adal create the implementation for this new class.

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,920
Package could be used right now are user Doud got IGMP implementation user.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,780
I am is the class.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:56,230
Click on Add and they should implement that user be able to select that.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,130
OK.

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,400
Finish.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,860
We don't have any metrics to implement this class with that repository annotation from Spring.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,800
Because this is going to do all the database work and it needs some transactional support.

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,800
And it depends on if you look at the diagram it depends on hibernate template to do its work.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:30,150
So let's add that as a dependency hibernate template control space use the one from hibernate 5

18
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:43,530
but neat template see it make sure that it is from the hibernate file package it controlled one generate

19
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,210
of setters.

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,300
OK.

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:57,800
Similarly create the services Slayer class right click new start with the interface user service is

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:08,540
the class package com dot dot user dot service or services finish

23
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,390
and create the implementation for the service new class.

24
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:25,160
It was a service I am click on and it was a service

25
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,340
that interface hit finish

26
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,660
and we need to market with it so we annotation from spring.

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,930
So the Dow was Makara with repository.

28
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,810
This obviously is micro with ex-service and the service.

29
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:52,640
If you look at that Agonum it depends on the user or Tao to do its work so that user interface here

30
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,260
will be injecting the implementation are automatically splitting will inject the implementation later

31
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,070
on.

32
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:11,250
It was that or Dow Dow and market with it auto wired annotation similarly copy this on the dollar immobiliser

33
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,010
and we need to markhor hibernate template with it.

34
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:22,380
Ottaway location I'm back with the service make this private control one agenda getters and setters.

35
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,160
Okay.

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,150
Format it.

37
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,290
So we have successfully created two layers.

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,020
The Dow and the services.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,630
Let's go to the controller layer which is our UI and the final layer in our application right click

40
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,380
new Plus you know we don't need any interface name is user control.

41
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,890
Package.

42
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:56,970
Com dot dot it's being autem NBC Autum dot dot CON-TROLL finish in the controller class should be macrobid

43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,300
it controller annotation I'm spinning.

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,020
You said your type annotation again and this depends on the user service.

45
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,310
So they use that in the controller user.

46
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:24,640
So this is the interface garlics service and market with auto wired annotation and gendered that getters

47
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,240
and setters

48
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,360
formatted controls you have to do that.

49
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,960
So you have completed all the layers creating the interfaces and classes and also why adding the dependencies.
