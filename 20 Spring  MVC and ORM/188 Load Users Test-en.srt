00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,870
This lecture will test the display users call.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,380
We have just written by accessing the controller from the web browser to do that right click or otherwise

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,110
run on server finish.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:21,760
Once that allocation starts then grabbed the or to crawl onto our favorite browser.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:33,930
Paste the warm spring autumn slash display get users get users is what we are used you capital in the

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:43,760
controller that that will go to the controller all the way to services down there and it loads our user

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,880
data to see the ID the name and that email id.

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,720
Let's do a better formatting.

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,150
Go back to the days page.

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:02,770
We'll put it inside of his DML table outside the for loop create the table rabbit.

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:11,890
We landed after the each each right here for each object in the list are for each row in the database

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,360
we need to create the table row.

13
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:24,150
Let's create the table row and heading outside here outside the for loop ph for table Hading knows the

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,210
hitch IB is the first field.

15
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,830
Copy that.

16
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,250
And our people are hurting bestit couple of times.

17
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,400
Second is name.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:47,370
Third is e-mail Similarly for each of these here we'll have it Tia closed that table row at that and

19
00:01:47,980 --> 00:02:00,700
B are last year and for each of these fields are they the BE table data and close table data right there.

20
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,710
Similarly for the other two table data open table data.

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,350
Close it

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,220
close the table data control shift to format.

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:22,470
So we have successfully included a hasty table to add a border if we want to border is equal to 1 save

24
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,600
it go back to the web browser load it again refresh the browser and you see it in a hasty multi-table

25
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,450
if you want to you can insert more cards and you can see that in action as well.
