1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,540
You have successfully created the user and also displayed the list of users on the UI in this lecture

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,400
you are going to sort the users that we are displaying on the UI the list we are returning from the

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,300
user so is Imbolc can be sought.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,550
But how do implement the compatible interface on our model so that it can be used for sorting.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,350
So go to the user dot Java and implements compatible if you remember from core Java compatible is an

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,240
interface that should be implemented and the gender type in this case is use that we want to compare

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,560
to use that objects and sort them had control one had and implemented amateur's change this idea to

8
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:51,020
in Bija so that our life will be a lot more easier in Bija you can change it here.

9
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,070
Its ok to really do the art of boxing Pharez.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,000
But when we implement the Compared to matter it would be a lot easier.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,290
Change this parameter name to user return.

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,810
We can say this Daut I want this sorted by ID.

13
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:14,740
So this dot dot com I can use the compare to method which is available on the wrapper type 2 user dot

14
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,440
ID.

15
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,390
So I am combating and retaining the IDs.

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,000
You can also sorted by name and email but for now sort it by the ID start the server have stopped myself.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,210
So lets start it if its up and running for you can restart it.

18
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,820
And if you go to the controller I want to add a few more cards in the database right now I only have

19
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,680
one card in my database.

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,930
Lets add a few more so that we can see sorting and action.

21
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:57,470
So registration page is that you are and we should be using right click on eyes on server finish that

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,520
we launched here.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,840
So paste that you are our copy this you or I'll go to Chrome which is much better than the eclipse default

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,530
browser.

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
Paste that link.

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,380
Grab that link from Eclipse come back.

27
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,530
Paste it right at the beginning and it should be a registration page at the end and that will take us

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,500
to the form which we can submit and create.

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,430
Couple more users IDs one name is John John at gmail dot com.

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,870
His email addy Jaun at gmail dot com.

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:45,920
Submit and it creates a user with ID one cleared one more to Bob is the name Bob at gmail dot com submit.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,790
Now we have three the cards in the database.

33
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,060
Select and we have three cards.

34
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,400
Let's see how they would come back with a UI and sort of register page.

35
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,000
It should be.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,070
Get users you Capital get users will feature the users and displayed in a table if you see they are

37
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,780
not sorted by AB 789 comes first then one and then to go back to the Soviet mentor or the Soviets this

38
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,850
class which is US-Soviet simple.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,120
And then the get users do their collections Daut sort Corrections is a little class that can start a

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,420
lot of collections.

41
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,580
And this collection starts sort of wide type.

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:39,160
So saying this variable hit condoled one beyond our find users should be assigned to a variable then

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,310
we should start them.

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm going to stop my server squad it up so that you can see it clearly.

45
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:58,210
The word art find users assign it by hitting control one local variable call it users get rid of this

46
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:05,040
sort of dump collection starts sort users and then return users.

47
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,940
Now stop the server

48
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,240
and 1:06 back up or.

49
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,080
Go back to the web browser refresh this page which is get users

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,760
and this time and it fit just that a card.

51
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,380
It should sort them by.

52
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,520
I'd say how successfully implemented that compatible interface on our model of class and you how Sautter

53
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,530
that ecards based on their IDE.
