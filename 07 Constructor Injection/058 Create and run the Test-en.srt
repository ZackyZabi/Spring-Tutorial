1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,410
In this lecture, we'll create the test class and see the constructor injection in action.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:13,690
So get started by right clicking on the new package, Class, Test with s main method, finish.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,000
You can copy over the prior tests if you want to, but I'm going to type.

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:28,620
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("");

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,120
Pass in the config.xml.

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,390
Grab the package name so that it will find the conflig.xml under the appropriate folders

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,690
on the classpath. Forward slash, change all the dots to forward slashes.

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:01:03,290
Two more. Hit control+1 on ApplicationContext. Spell it correctly, ApplicationContext. Control+1, import it

9
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,970
from Spring.

10
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,280
context.getBean(); read the bean.

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,400
That's the second step, so that we can use it.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,350
The bean is employee in the config.xml, that is the name of our main bean, Employee.

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,290
Employee e is equal to, typecast it because it is an object

14
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,500
sysout, e. Do a control+shift+f to format. Run the test, right

15
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:46,140
click, Run as -> Java Application. That runs and prints the employee details for us along with the address

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,130
that we have configured.

17
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,560
House number is 123,

18
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,680
Street is mira mesa and city is san diego.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,970
So we have successfully used constructor injection.

20
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,620
And if you see, we have mixed both property as well as constructor injection here. The address itself

21
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:10,080
we have used P schema. That is, using setter injection we have injected the values into address. And then, when we created

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,400
the employee, the spring container, we configured it to create the employee using the constructor injection.
