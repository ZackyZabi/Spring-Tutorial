00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,580
In this lecture explain the flaw of what exactly happened and we ran our best and successfully inserted

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:13,920
a card into the database when we ran our test the configuration file is lorded by the spinning container.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,260
It reads our on for example in which we have two bins.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,800
The first one is the datasource been.

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,990
So the second one is The Daily Beast template.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:30,560
Been putting notes that the Daily Beast template needs the datasource being so it will create that dependency

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,740
and well creating it.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,720
It provides the form properties the driver class name the user name and password the datasource Bean

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,190
is the one which creates the connection internally.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,800
The Daily Beast template will use the data source to create a connection create a statement and it is

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,620
responsible for executing that insert statement as well.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,390
So internally spring Daily Beast template will take care of collection creation creating the statement

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,820
and executing it.

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,910
And at the end it uses the integer result and we can do whatever we want to do with that result.

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,420
That is the beauty of using the basic template.

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:18,870
Without writing all the Breillat plate calling it which we do enjoy Ribisi we can simply execute sequel's

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,950
statement.
