1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,540
So far we have been using the ModelAndView object as a return type to the methods in our Controller.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,380
This ModelAndView design is tightly coupled.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,310
That is, in our Controller methods, even though we don't use the model or data

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,800
in some scenarios, we still have to create the ModelAndView object. That is why in later versions of

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,430
Spring they have introduced ModelMap and ViewName as a simple string.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:34,340
So if you don't want to deal with data in a particular Controller method, then we need not create

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,970
the ModelAndView. We simply create the view name as a String, java string object and return it from the

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,850
method.

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,050
And if we have to deal with the model or data in the Controller method, then we will use the ModelMap

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,080
The ModelMap is like a map with key and value pairs.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,650
The key is a string and the value is an object and it provides a method called addAttribute using which

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,960
we can add data to the ModelMap. A good scenario where we can consider this whole usecase is if we

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,310
go back to the user registration usecase, open the UserController and in the very first method, here

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,980
showRegistrationPage,

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,760
we do not have a model here.

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,640
All we are doing is taking the request from the user and sending him a view back.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,800
Even then we are creating a ModelAndView and returning it. In the next lecture, we'll migrate, we'll

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,130
use the ModelMap and string in these two methods instead of using ModelAndView.
