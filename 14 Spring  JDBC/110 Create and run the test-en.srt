00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,080
This lecture We'll update our test class Open the best darned Java under-employed test package.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,330
Let's fix the package names etc..

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:20,370
Befre spinning JEDEC dot employee or forward slash employees less desk to copy that forward slash or

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,830
dot add a forward slash that will do and this time we are not going to read J.D. B.S. template.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,200
We are reading the employee be able.

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:35,000
That is the name of the bean which we have configured in the conflict for example will read that Dow

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:45,580
type cast it into employee be able we can use the interface because that interface is implemented by

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,260
them Pleydell impelled.

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,200
Get rid of these two lines here.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:00,770
End result is equal to call this the Will not that there really is a template.

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,120
Be able darte create.

12
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,490
We need to pass in a new employee.

13
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,120
So create that here New Employee object semi-colon control.

14
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:21,230
One important employee set up this new employee control one extract to local variable.

15
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,570
Eclipse will do it for us.

16
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,510
We know we need to add some data into this object employed dart set.

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:35,930
ID is the first one ID is to send in Digest or get it off double quotes you have value of do we already

18
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,460
have a field in the database with ID of one.

19
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,700
So lets start with two and Dot set.

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:02:02,240
First name is equal to John employee got lost or said last name is equal to for gusano.

21
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:10,510
One of my colleagues John Ferguson capital save it use whatever names you want.

22
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:16,570
You need not use sophisticated names if you feel that this sets up a stick and the control shift or

23
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,660
to organize or import.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,830
So in this lecture you have successfully created the test class with the right package names for the

25
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,120
configured example.

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,270
Then when you read the bean which is employed from the spring container and how in walked the create

27
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,160
method by passing it the Employee object instead of simply passing values.

28
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,690
We are getting the result and we are displaying the result.

29
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:50,510
Let's run it right click run as Java application and everything is wired and access number of records

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,360
inserted are one.

31
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,370
Go to the database on my siecle workbench on the set.

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,730
One more time and we see two records.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,410
Now the next lecture will explain the flow and trend.
