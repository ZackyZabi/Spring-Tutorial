This lecture Cherryville implement the Map Room mattered the days you are going to read from the resultset

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,220
in Walk the letters on the resultset and I will set the values by creating an employee object.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,390
So let's get started by creating it Employee object employee.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,150
MP is it called the new employee

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,840
MP Daut set.

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,870
Let's start with the IB r s dot.

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,810
Get in.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,160
The ID is of type integer Bhasin the column index it starts with one.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,930
We know that the first column in the database is the ID that is the reason we are using one and setting

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,990
it into MP Daut set the next ENP darte set.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,140
First name ORUs d'arte get to column 2.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,520
It should be get screened get x x x Smethurst based on the paper we pass and string in double.

13
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,160
Except for bits of type string.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Finally employed Daut set last name to start get screened again for the last name and the index's 3

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,150
and return that employ.

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,170
That's it.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,040
It's that simple to implement the map roll mattered.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,940
Spring will give us the resultset at runtime.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,890
We are getting the results out of the results that creating an object of our own type and returning

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,200
it in the next lecture.

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,410
You will create the test and see it in action.
