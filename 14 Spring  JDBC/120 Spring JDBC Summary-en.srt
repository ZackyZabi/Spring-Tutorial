In this lecture I will summarize what you have learned from the spring.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:10,560
Julie B.C section the spring JEDEC takes care of all the repetitive chord that we typically write when

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,000
we directly use the jelly B.C API in our applications.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,830
It also takes care of the checked exceptions that we need to handle when we use the daily API.

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,970
We simply use their daily B.S. template by defining it in the spring configuration.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,610
And it depends on the data source which takes care of the connection creation the data source requires

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,650
a driver class name in order to connect to the data source a user name for the data source or the database.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,710
And finally the password to connect to the database so the data source object is created by the spring

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,430
and then it inject it into the database template.

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,460
Once we have a template in our application process we can perform the DML operations that is insert

11
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,250
update delete using the update method on the very busy template and pass it as well.

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,630
And we can perform the Select queries if we are cutting for one single row one single object we can

13
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,270
use the query for object.

14
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,920
And if we are retrieving multiple rows from the database we use the query method.
