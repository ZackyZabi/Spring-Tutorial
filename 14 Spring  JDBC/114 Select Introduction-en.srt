1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,540
So far you have learned how to execute the non-selling statements using the GBC template that is they

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,780
insert a update and delete in this and the next few lectures you use the Daily Beast template and execute

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,390
the Select queries using two methods it provides one query for object which returns a single record

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,340
and query method which returns multiple records from the database table.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,590
The query for object X the sequel as string.

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,970
The second parameter is a new type called Roll mapper which you will learn in a second and then the

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,820
variable arguments.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,920
The second method is the method which takes only two arguments string sequel.

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,830
Their school statement the select statement and then the road map and it returns a list of objects not

10
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,100
just a single object like for object.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,680
That brings us to a new type called Rule mapper.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:08,730
Romancer is an interface in the Spring Framework which we need to implement it maps a daily B.C resultset

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:16,450
that comes back in do an object of a class that we create in our application.

14
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,850
Here is the room Appert architecture from our application we execute a select query using the very basic

15
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,650
template against a database.

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,250
We get all our rows back as a result set.

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,180
Then we use the road map or we create a roadmap or by implementing this rule mapper interface and our

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,940
class will or write a method within which will map the result set in object.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,570
So all that will do in the map roll method that we implement the map room at is from the roadmap an

20
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:53,500
interface we or I that we implement it and all that matter does is it gets the result out of the resultset

21
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,530
and we set it into our object in here I am reading the result from the results and setting it into the

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,460
object Karg employ.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,190
To summarize the exiguous select statements we use the query for object.

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,500
If it is a single record that we want our query if we want multiple records both these matters take

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,780
a roadmap for the job of the roadmap or it's an interface in the Spring Framework will create a class

26
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,840
that implements this interface within which we all read the map room or for that matter we simply map

27
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,570
from resultset to the object of our own in our application.
