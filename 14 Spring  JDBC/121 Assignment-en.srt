1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,060
Do work on the spring duty B.S. assignment will how to create a table called passenger in the database

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:14,680
which will how three fields IAB first name and last name will use the database a template and perform

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,210
the following four operations.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:22,360
Create the read update and delete all the crowd operations while performing greed.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,210
You will be using the rule mapper and you will be converting the data that comes back into air passenger

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,670
Jaba object.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,930
So you will need to create a class car passenger with these three fields and a road map or inside of

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,790
a road mapper.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,470
It will be reading these three fields and displaying them and you write their test class.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,820
So once you create the table the steps will be configuring the Julie B.C.E. template and datasource

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,760
in the spring configuration and then you will write a test class in which it will read the Daily Beast

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,480
template bean and perform the correct operations.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,430
As I said you will how to create a passenger class so that the data can be read back in Java object

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,060
when you do the read operation.

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,430
You will provide a real mapper so that the data can be converted.
