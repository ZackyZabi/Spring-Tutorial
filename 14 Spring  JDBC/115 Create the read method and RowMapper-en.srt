1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,870
In this lecture you will implement a method that will lead a single employee from the database table

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,200
to do that go to the employee interface and the matter will return.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:22,450
Employee object and you can call it read pass it single value called integer ID.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,310
So give an employee ID.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,500
It should read the employee record one single record from the database go to the employee now impled

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:41,070
it control one and implemented amateur's the end on Thursday and start implementing them.

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:53,870
Third we need to use the GBC template d'arte exit qued are not ready for object.

8
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,730
There are several or loaded versions and the version we are going to use will take that string as a

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,560
roadmap.

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,200
And also we can pass variable arguments.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,190
Let me call it up.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,190
And also more this method.

13
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:15,690
Up next to delete Jerry B.C template doc query for object is the matter.

14
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,610
Create the sequel string.

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,320
A school is equal to select star from employee.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,230
Their ID is equal to question mark you can have multiple conditions here is equal the question mark

17
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,590
and x are you going to have a complicated select query and you can pass variable arguments here.

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,300
But in this case we have only one argument one placeholder and that is coming in as the parameter so

19
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:53,730
passing that ID the next key step is to add a semicolon here and the next step is to implement the roadmap

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,100
or interface.

21
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,910
We don't have a roadmap for it so let's create a road map for class right click on this employee door

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:14,010
package see new class give it a name employee role map up and the package is changed to dot dot roll

23
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,830
map or add a new package.

24
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,590
Karl Rove mapper we can put all our own mappers here.

25
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,480
Click on.

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,350
I hired this room apper needs to implement the all mapa interface from not Jow I start swinging.

27
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,560
Please don't sell like this.

28
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,720
You should select it from ARG dot Spring Framework.

29
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,120
Ok finish

30
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,410
and it didn't implement all that mattered because we need to select that generic type here.

31
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,150
If you remove the generic type by default a role mapper will use object as the type selects provider

32
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,650
type.

33
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,470
We know that type with this employee we want this room roadmap to return the employee now hit Control

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,810
one.

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:04,500
Let's import this employee control one on the road map or add unimplemented amateur's and the only method

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,620
on the employee row mapper are the interface is the map row that gets the result set as well as the

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,250
row number it tells us which row is being currently processed.

38
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,070
We don't need it as of now.

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,330
We only need the result set.

40
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,590
It will do the remapping in the next lecture.
