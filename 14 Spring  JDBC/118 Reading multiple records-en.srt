1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,490
The previous lecture you have learned how to read a single record from that database and this lecture

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,230
will create a method that will read all the employer cards before we do that let's insert record manually

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,990
because we all have to come in discord if you want to exclude the insert You are welcome to do that

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:28,980
but I'm going to set the record manually from my skill work bench insert into employee values within

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,290
brackets 1 within single quotes that you can use your first name and last name.

6
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,340
You need not use.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,650
Witnessing And of course the period the

8
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,890
execute and that the traditions are dead a card in the database do a select and we have to record snow

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:01:00,430
parrot and Bob go back to eclipse or to imply Dao create a new method that will return a list of employees

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,520
read.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,410
That's it.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,300
That's the name of the matter.

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,990
You can also call it find if you want to.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,480
Until one imported from Java I doubt it or be employed.

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,160
Simple go all the way up until one the unimplemented matters that really are the read method.

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:27,580
At the end that wrap that matter come back up Bastet here do a control shift F. mix it up so that you

17
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,330
can see it.

18
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,750
Delete the.

19
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:44,340
String skill is equal to select star from employee you have to write a query that will get as multiple

20
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,890
records from the database you can have a WHERE clause.

21
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,130
But typically that Burtless should return multiple records

22
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,420
JT B.C template Daut query.

23
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,440
That said we are going to use the query which will take the school and the road map or school comma

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,500
row mapper which we need to create.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,790
So grab this roadmap or from up here.

26
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,010
Pastrycook pass that road map are to this method.

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,170
Can control one at the start of the line sign statement to a new local variable.

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,500
Select that and that will return a list of employees.

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,370
Since we are passing aero mapper which returns employee requirement that automatically returns a list

30
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,560
of employees.

31
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:45,670
We can return that list call it result and return that list go to test instead of invoking the read

32
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,550
method comment that line out and invoke the word dot.

33
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:59,050
Read an old one and sign statement to a new local variable.

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,220
Call it result

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,660
display the result.

36
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,470
We can also use a foreach loop.

37
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:17,420
Let's run this first reichlich run as Java application and that will display all the employees like

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,660
this.

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,340
You can also use it for each.

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,640
I read through the list and display each record as you want.

41
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,050
Let me maximize this or that you can see it clearly we have Beauregard's Bob Ferguson.

42
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:37,950
And at the period the rate works when we run this test you know what happens it goes to the Dow in the

43
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,360
Dow.

44
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,230
Daily Beast the template directory will fetch at resultset with multiple cards and Springville call

45
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,970
this employee roadmap.

46
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,350
This map room a third for each card in the reserve set.

47
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,590
And this matter Rattansi and play object for every red card in that database or every card in that is

48
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,390
an asset.

49
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:06,920
And finally we get results liftoff results back Springville the list of employees and we are returning

50
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,320
it which we are displaying in the desk plus.
