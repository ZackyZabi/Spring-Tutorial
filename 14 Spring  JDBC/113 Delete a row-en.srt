00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,200
In this lecture you implement the delete method by using the following query.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,100
We want to delete a card from the Employee table give an.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,450
Let's do that

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,810
go to the interface first employee.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:25,380
Now in Dejah delete in this case we only need the ID we don't need the complete Employee object or employed.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:33,740
Embattled head control one are unimplemented amateurs to caught up in Eclipse you can select the core

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,130
all the art button on your keyboard and press the up arrow and that will move the complete code up and

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,040
control shift to format control be to delete the truth.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,590
And in here you can grab these three lines from here paste it in delete.

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:01:00,110
Change the query can we delete delete from employee.

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,510
That is equal to a question mark and we pass in the ID here.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,540
Sequel is fine and we only need one parameter in this case which is ID.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,350
That's is pretty simple.

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,380
We got the query and we are using the ID and we will update metheglin variable arguments and we are

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,120
returning the result to test comment or the update portion.

16
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,560
And end result is equal to Dow d'arte delete.

17
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,610
Passing the ID one.

18
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,450
Let's delete my data card which is buried in the database.

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,520
Go to sequela bench execute the query.

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,180
Regards Bharathi probably has an eighty one that's come back from the test and here before we do that

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:01,550
number of the cards there should be there next run the best and it stays number off the guards delete

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,630
it off of one.

23
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:09,960
Let's make sure it is good to select and we have only one record which is Bob Fogelson.
