1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,850
In this lecture you will create the test class and we insert a card into our database table that is

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,780
the Employee table which doesn't have any records.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,020
Currently if we exclude the SAT ACT right now it doesn't break down any ID cards.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:21,600
So let's insert a card by using the basic template in our best plus create a new test last night on

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:33,280
the package new class based with the main Mathare finish by now you know each and every step to create

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,730
a test class application context.

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:46,440
Context is equal to a new class but some model application context has in the configuration conflict

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,140
darte example the package from here based the package slash If you want to I wired this package thing

9
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,350
you can copy the config file directly under the SLC folder.

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:08,350
In that case we need not you the entire package you know that from spring core use forward slash.

11
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,460
But since we are creating so many config files we better keep them under package just under one.

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,760
Add the import for application context.

13
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,180
You can also call this DBI context or beby conflict dot.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,210
If you want to do context Daut get B in the B name.

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,980
If you remember is JTB template.

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,990
The capital Ribisi template semi-colon.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,820
Control one assign statement be a local variable that will make it the object change to JTB see it control

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,370
space for template from Spring Framework.

19
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:57,900
Select that one again add cost to get EBC template been.

20
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,590
Call it Ribisi template.

21
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,960
Now we have the Daily Beast template we can use the update operation that are overloaded wash and software

22
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:18,030
update and we are going to use one that big sequel and variable arguments pass in the sequel.

23
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:25,780
You can create a string sequel spritely string Escurial is equal to insert within double court insert

24
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,940
into the table name which is employee values.

25
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:39,790
If you go to the table its employees small and we have three fields Id first name and last name employee.

26
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:48,890
All small values within brackets question mark comma question mark comma question mark.

27
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,050
Close the double quotes so I am not providing the values here.

28
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,920
If you know the Daily Beast prepared statement.

29
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,600
This question marks are placeholders and will provide the values here so pass in the Escuela to the

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,620
update method as the first parameter and the next three arguments are the values which will be replacing

31
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,100
the question marks.

32
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,030
So the first value is the ID.

33
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,670
Let's say the here in argument one is diety.

34
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,750
Or you can create a new bigger one diety.

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,030
That's the first argument.

36
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,970
Comma part is the first name you can use your first name and sort of part and last name is period.

37
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,160
I'm passing in three parameters which will be used by spring to replace these three question marks when

38
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,350
it prepares the prepared statement and it's and this update.

39
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,060
It returns the integer value back which tells us the number of cards that got inserted or updated or

40
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,880
deleted.

41
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,510
End result is equal to that 6 out

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:08,960
number of records inserted our colon space plus the result and that's it.

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:21,980
And third shift to format right click on and see job allocation and the inserted number of girds inserted.

44
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,990
Are 1 go to the database

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,120
the select one more time and you see that data 1 but not in the period.

46
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,470
I will explain the flow in that next lecture.
