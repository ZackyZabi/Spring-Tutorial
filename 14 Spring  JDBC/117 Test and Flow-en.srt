1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,690
The last step is to use the employee roadmap or in our dollar impel.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:11,010
Update our test and test it to use the roadmap or you can create an instance of it right here employee

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:23,160
role map to correlate road map is equal to new employee roadmap to big that object and pass it here.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,960
Control shift to format and that should return employees so you can take the results that are coming

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,730
from here.

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:38,030
It control one and sign statement to any local variable.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,700
And that will return Employee object because we are passing aerial map of pipe which should have done

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,340
and applied.

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,550
So we are returning it back at the return statement return.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,390
Employee

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,890
So here once again the reason we see an employee coming back from for object is because the road map

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,660
or type that we have implemented is for the employee genetic backup.

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,390
Let's upgrade the test go to test comment board the delete portion

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,020
Dow dart read and pass in and let's pass.

15
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,110
Let's check the database to see what it has right now.

16
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,830
All it has is one row with ID 2.

17
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,910
Let's use that to is the ID.

18
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,180
It controls one to and the statement to a new local variable.

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,940
Call that employee.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,370
That's the result we are getting back.

21
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:49,080
Display the results change this text to employee record Seybert.

22
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:56,230
We already have an employee created up here for updates and leads you can comment out that portion.

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,030
We don't need the Employee object in this case or comment out portion as well.

24
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:12,910
Right click on that test as job application and we see the employee at a car coming back and the details

25
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,460
are being printed.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,620
So the flow is the container creates all the beans.

27
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,370
Then when we invoke this reed matter in the employee of Ambuhl The Daily Beast it complex query for

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,850
object will be invoked.

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,090
The sequel will be passed in along with the roadmap that will be passed so the statement will be executed

30
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,260
against the database result set comes back JTB said as an asset is what comes back to spring.

31
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,620
Spring Springville use the roadmap that we have provided by invoking the map third it passes in that

32
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,610
is all set.

33
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,860
It gets Employee object back because that is what we are doing inside that matter and it will return

34
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,480
it back to the employee Dol impellor.
