00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,430
In this lecture I will explain the flow end to end and summarize what you have achieved in the last

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,470
few lectures and we ran best.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,460
The spring has always it's the configuration file and in the configuration file you can find three bins.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,030
The first being is the employee be able implementation.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,430
This Been needs the daily the template being to work so the container will then tried to create the

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,360
DBC template bin and The Daily Beast template depends on datasource.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,540
So this being container will look for the data source bin.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,890
It will find it here.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,640
It will create an instance of it by using the information we have already provided here.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,740
Then it indexed that datasource into the database template and it uses the database a template object

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,240
to inject it into the employee or Imbolc while creating an object off the employee impellor and then

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,580
we are creating employee BP or setting the data in to it and we are invoking the create method on the

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660
Dow being which we are reading from spring and in the create matter.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,910
We are using this very basic template which we have injected in the configuration.

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,340
Exclude the update method which makes the sequel and the 3 values for which we have placeholders here.

16
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,380
The question marks.

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,190
So spring will replace them.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,090
Here is the update and we saw the result already.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,280
So this is a pattern which we typically follow in real time applications instead of a test.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,020
Plus we would inject this Deewar in our business object plus the next layer class in Java the application.
