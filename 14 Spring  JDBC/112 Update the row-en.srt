1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,930
This lecture he will implement the update method in our employee.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,500
He will be using a query like this update employee set the first name to a placeholder.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,890
We are going to provide that value.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,860
Last name Zeke will the question mark where given the burglar Id say you're going to update the first

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,580
name and last name given Id do that go to eclipse.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:36,900
Open up the employee walk first the interface create a new method int update give an employee object.

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,170
We are going to update it

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,860
to the implementation and by da Imphal hit Control 1.

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,990
Add and implemented amateur's.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,850
Now that we have everything in place it's going to be very easy cut it pasted right next to create that

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,970
shift after format.

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:04,510
The only piece that will change here is instead of insert We are going to use an update and we pass

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:13,680
the parameters differently get rid of everything in the double quotes Abbate employee is the table set

14
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,060
first name all lowercase is equal to a question mark comma last name is equal to.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,450
Question mark.

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,490
There IAB is equal to question mark.

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:31,440
So we have use of placeholders for the values will set those values when we invoke the update matter.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,150
JTB see template d'arte update.

19
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,840
We lose the same one which we have used for insert string sequel and the second is variable arguments

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:52,510
passing arguments the first placeholder is the employee got get first name come up for the second placeholder

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:02:01,460
employee not get the last name and for the last placeholder the ID that ID is equal to a question mark.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:11,150
Employee Daut get ID ones that executes it will return the integer result get control one end statement

23
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,550
to a new local variable.

24
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,110
Call it result and return that result.

25
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,910
Until you do format and we have successfully implemented the subject matter.

26
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,580
Now go to the test.

27
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:33,040
Plus comment out this create fortune where we are invoking create and use int.

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,360
The result is equal to be able dot update and pass in the employee.

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:49,810
Let's change the jaunt to that say Bob Ferguson in the database if you exclude the sequel right now

30
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,910
if we exclude the select query we have two records.

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,800
The second one is John Ferguson.

32
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,440
Once we run our test it should be updated to Bob Ferguson the first name should change to Bob here.

33
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,430
Let's see if that happens by running our test

34
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,310
and access number of cards inserted.

35
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,350
So let's change that.

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,870
It should be number of cards updated.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,340
Let's go check the database to see the result.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,190
Run the query and it got changed.

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:19,680
Bob.
