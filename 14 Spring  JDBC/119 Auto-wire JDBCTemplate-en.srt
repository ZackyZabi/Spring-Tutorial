1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,030
Know that you know how to use the GBC template to perform cad operations against a database in this

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,110
lecture you will learn how to auto wire this very basic template.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,590
If we go to the employee we're impelled we haven't wired it but instead we have used the configuration

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,040
to inject the database the template into the employee.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,030
So let's get rid of this we not defined the been here the lead the Dow impled been from the configuration

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,770
go to the employee down in pulp the very first step to start using annotations is to mark our Been with

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,310
that component annotation from Spring.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,900
Do that.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:48,210
This tells spring that this class an object of this class can be created the next annotation is at Arto

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,290
wired and spring will automatically inject it provided we enable annotations as well as contex type

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:02,690
1 component scan in the conflict Daut example where they're added right at the beginning you can add

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,320
it in context.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:13,350
I found a colon component hyphen can provide the base package which is the Dow impels package.

14
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,400
We should provide the implementation package not the interfaces package.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
They are different now.

16
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,430
It's a border configured based package you can PLO's this element right here we control shift to format

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,520
a rerun that best.

18
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,520
That is an exception.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,080
Let's see what the problem is no such being employed now available.

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,540
That's because in the past we are trying to read the bean as employee doll.

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:54,650
But if you remember by default spring will create the class using the class name or create the object

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,670
using the class name.

23
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,080
So let's provide the name here within brackets.

24
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,240
Employee.

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,310
Now that is what we are using in our best employee be able.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,860
So once you give it you will create the being with that name and it should be available.

27
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,050
And this time it works successfully.

28
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,150
So in this letter you have successfully Ottaway or the daily busy template or by mocking our POJO with

29
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,830
that component annotation use of that word annotation on the BBC template.

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,550
And in the config you have provided the base package for the container to scan by using the context

31
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,440
colon components can.
