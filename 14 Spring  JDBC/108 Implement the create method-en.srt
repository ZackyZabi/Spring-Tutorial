1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,420
In this lecture will vie The Daily Beast template into them play the away and use it in the create method

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:14,960
to insert the card into the database that gets started by creating a new field called wait Judy we see

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,970
it control space template Spring Framework oller GBC template

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:31,280
create a room set amateurs it control one create getter and setter it OK to a control shift to format

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,880
and we can use it inside the create matter.

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,430
Now you already know that Korti how written it in the Test class.

7
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,890
But in this case we are not going to use their application context in their Dalrymple's we simply use

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,490
the Daily Beast template radically.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,520
And then in the next lecture we will configure it.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,770
We are doing it the other way around said go to imply dhal impulse.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:03,890
Use the JTB see template dark update the access string and object parameters.

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:13,380
You know that sequel grab the sequel from best class copy this statement come back to the Dalrymple

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,990
inside the third string.

14
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,010
Scale is equal to insert into employee and the values with three placeholders.

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,300
We'll use that as well.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,680
And the argument this time instead of hard coding them we lose it from the employee don't get AB is

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:37,890
the first one employee darte get first name is the second parameter employee don't get the last name

18
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,980
is the last and third parameter.

19
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,930
And this returns an integer result get control 1 signed statement to a new local variable call it result

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:58,010
and return that result instead of the zero delete any blank lines of to format in this lecture you have

21
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,340
successfully implemented the create method by using the BBC template.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,300
Well why are they still the basic template.

23
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,100
In the next lecture in the conflict got eczema.

24
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,280
And also will create the best class.
