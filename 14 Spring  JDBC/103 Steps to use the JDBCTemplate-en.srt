1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,860
In the next few lectures he will learn how easy it is to perform database operations using spring JTB

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,420
CPP template.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,210
He will do it in two simple steps.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,290
The first step is to configure the driver manager data source and The Daily Beast template.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,230
In this configuration there man is a data source will be used by JTB template.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,440
So you'll first inject this being or you will first create this being or configured.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,830
This being in the Phoring can pick the example by setting for properties.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,890
The class name you want to connect to the database the user name to the database and finally the password.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,050
In my case I'm using the Skrill driver so it would be my column brought my escarole dart the DBC Daut

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,250
driver and this is that you are a that we need to connect to the my Escorial DBI running on my machine.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,550
My DB is the name of the database local host windes to my machine.

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,310
And here we have the protocol SoBo protocol.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,350
The user name is routine in my case and the password is best.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,730
Once we can figure out the driver manager data source the next bin is the GBC template will configure

15
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:16,160
that bin by injecting the data source that recreate in the previous to these two and going to this same

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,730
spring configuration file as two different beings.

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,820
There really is a template depends on our manager data that is step number one.

18
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,750
And the second step of course is create the best class and use the GBC template to perform it insert

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,560
operation or any other update operation on the database.
