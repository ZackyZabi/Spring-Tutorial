1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,790
In this lecture you will walk on the very first step which is to create the configuration file and create

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,960
the driver manager data source and Daily Beast template beings go to eclipse grab the configuration

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,160
file from Springwater advanced or two source mean Java.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,690
Pick it from any of the packages those that come back pasted on this package.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,960
Get rid of this app Dardar we don't need it.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,820
We're going to create a test class later on.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,000
OK open the configured example.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,250
Maximize it.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,940
Delete everything inside it.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,220
All the bins.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,030
All we need is the root bean tag.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,670
It has the required namespace just like the schema except to get started with the B in the very first

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,430
bin we want to create is the driver manager data source.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,520
We don't have the package name of it so we can either google for it or another way is to do it control

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:06,830
shift be eclipse and search for driver manager data source.

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,580
So Eclipse can search for it on the classpath and if you click that double click it to open it opens

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,620
a decompilers that dark place file and opens it.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,520
In your case if it doesn't decompile at least open up as you read it can see the class name the package

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,790
name etc..

20
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:31,830
So scroll up all the way up and you can grab the Bakkies name from the control see come back to the

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:43,670
configured Sammul bean CLOS is equal to within the courts bath the package back scroll down and get

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,330
that last name which is driver manager data source.

23
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,340
This way we can ensure that we are using the right package in place name we can't remember the entire

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,860
package so we know how to google for it or use Control shift B and then search for de-worm manager datasource

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
in Eclipse.

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,310
Give it a name you can give it water what name you want.

27
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,280
That's called Data capital source to inject the form properties.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
Let's use the schema.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,190
That is the easiest way to do it.

30
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:24,050
Driver class name is the first one so the colon Raber class name is equal to within the court.

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,410
For my Escuela it is com Daut might as well start JTB see Dorte braver.

32
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,860
That is the name of the driver last name of the driver.

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,160
Next is be call.

34
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:47,770
You are all small by the class name has case sees capital and in its capital you Oreille all small is

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,850
equal to.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,970
But then of course the Ribisi call an

37
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:04,230
my you is this a protocol call in to forward slashes local host slash.

38
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,720
My database name is my baby.

39
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,050
You have control f to format so that it goes to the next line.

40
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,640
Next property call in user name.

41
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:22,270
All small is equal to root is the user and the last property peacoat and password all small again is

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,800
required to within double courts.

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,380
Best we can close that been Dagget idea can't you if you have to format and we have the data source

44
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,060
bin.

45
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:39,880
Next we can create the dependent which depends on this data source that is the database the template

46
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,910
being class is equal to.

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,200
We know the class name it is the BBC template but we don't know the package.

48
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,650
So the best thing to do.

49
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,640
Control shift be.

50
00:03:49,870 --> 00:04:02,360
Search for JTB see template open that up scroll up all the way up grab the Bakkies name it's our Spring

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,810
Framework.

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,320
Julie B.C dark gone come back.

53
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,110
Bastet dot JEDEC template.

54
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,930
So JS capital B B C small template.

55
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:23,910
So it is a common case that name is equal to the Ribisi B Gabbidon template.

56
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,860
And the only property we need to inject into Edgerly we see a template is this data source.

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,490
Let's use the schema again.

58
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,520
The colon you know how to do that to do as reference will get the name of it.

59
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,950
So the name of the datasource property inside the government as a data source.

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:52,250
If you go here or inside Ribisi template go to a very basic template search for a control f data source.

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,550
Keep searching for the property and the property name is datasource.

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,480
If you see it here.

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:09,330
So we got to use the same exact property name we open that declaration it is sitting it right here so

64
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:20,940
go back to the configuration Piccola data source hyphen ref because it is a reference type you the name

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,850
which is datasource.

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,450
Copy that pasted right here and you can close the bean bag right here.

67
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,060
You don't need the ending element to a control shift to format.

68
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,150
So we have successfully completed the first step that is configuring their data source being the driver

69
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,930
manager data source and also the database template.
