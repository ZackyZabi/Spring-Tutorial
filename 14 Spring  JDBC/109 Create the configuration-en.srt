1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,740
The previous lecture we have either a field called Julie B template which the employee of the wimple

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,760
used in the create method we have underwired that though using spring.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,330
So we need to do that in this lecture will create a configuration file and also copy or the test and

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,780
we'll work on the test in the next lecture.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,560
Right click on the door package see new package.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,700
The mother doll and another employee will create a package card.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,830
Best finish is where we'll put our configuration and the test.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:41,500
So grab the best and the config from our earlier work based on the test package open the conflict and

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,150
we'll work on the best in the next lecture configured example.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,420
We already have the JD b c template or the data source and The Daily Beast the template being defined

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,090
here.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,050
Now if you remember our use case we know how to configure the employee will simple which uses the very

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,790
basic template.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:07,040
So let's create a new bean class is equal to grab the class name.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,740
We need to inject the employee or impled not the interface.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,230
We learned it earlier and it worked with injection of interfaces copy the package name come back to

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:25,600
configure based or class dot or the package go back grab the class name which is the employee the impulse

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:35,690
come back Bastet space name is equal to give it a name call it employee be able to close the bean tag

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,150
and within the being that we'll use property injection.

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,020
So a property name is equal to DBC template.

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,820
That is the field which we have defined in the doll symbol right here.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:02:08,630
That is the field name laws it use ref element and being is equal to the name of the bean which is EBC

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,650
template which is defined right here.

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:20,620
So copy that and based on Baulch f format and we are all set in the next lecture we'll create a test

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,180
class and test this employee in.
