1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,340
In this lecture you will create an object in two simple steps. That is, you are going to create an instructor

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,390
class, mark it with the @Component annotation and then create the configuration which will have the context:

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,050
component-scan element.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:22,450
And ofcourse finally you will create a test class to see it all in action. Go to Eclipse, right click,

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,120
create a new class called Instructor or Teacher.

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:44,810
com.bharath.springcoreadvanced.stereotype.annotations. Finish. The instructor will

7
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:51,710
have an int id to start with, the String name.

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:59,180
Let's start with those two fields. Control+1, create getter and setters. Control+1 for the name, create getters and

9
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,940
setters as well.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,110
Hit Ok. Control+shift+f to format. Source,

11
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,280
generate the toString method.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,130
OK and we have the toString method. The second step is to create the configuration file. Grab the earlier

13
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:22,680
configuration, paste it. Open it. Get rid of everything in the configuration.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,110
We need only one single element, that is the beauty of using stereotype annotations. From the context

15
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:37,540
namespace, it is not annotation-config, it is context:component-scan. We can close it right here.

16
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,760
We don't need an ending element. And for the attribute base-package, we should provide the package

17
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,130
the Spring container needs to scan for the classes marked with @Component annotation.

18
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,870
We haven't marked our instructor with the @Component annotation.

19
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:05,070
Let's do that. @Compo, control+space from org.springframework.stereotype. This is the package,

20
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,730
org.springframework.stereotype.Component is the annotation.

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:16,060
Once we do that, grab this package name and put it in the configuration file.

22
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:23,720
We can also use subpackages even if you say com.bharath.springcoreadvanced, Spring container will

23
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,960
scan the sub packages of it as well.

24
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,120
But let's be very specific and give the complete package.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,100
Remove any spaces and that's it. The last step is to create a test.

26
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,710
This particular element here also internally enables the annotation config. So it also enables all the

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,730
annotations and then it also scans this package.

28
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,090
We need not use the context:annotation-config anymore.

29
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,910
You are welcome to use it, but it is not required.

30
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,910
Copy the test.

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
That is the last step.

32
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,750
Paste it. Open the test. We've got to change the package names as well as the objects.

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,140
The object is Instructor.

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,160
Copy it, paste it on the left side.

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,880
Call it instructor, and display the instructor. The bean name if you remember, by default,

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,580
if you go back to the theory portion, Spring will create an object with this name, the same name as the

37
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,070
class,

38
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,630
but in camel case. So instructor will be the name of the bean. Grab the package name from here.

39
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,860
stereotype.annotations.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:45,170
Copy that, get rid of standalone and collections or whichever package you have and change it to

41
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:56,530
stereotype/annotations/config.xml. And that's it. Right click, run the java application and

42
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,940
you will see the instructor object.

43
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,580
Ofcourse it has the default values, we are not injecting any values.

44
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,360
I will show you how to inject values later on.

45
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,770
To summarize, in this lecture you have created an object or a class called Instructor. You have marked

46
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,020
it with @Component annotation which tells the Spring container that an object of this class can be

47
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:23,990
created or should be created. And the second step was in a configuration file, you've told Spring which packages

48
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:31,530
it needs to scan for the classes to create objects for using the context:component-scan.
