In this lecture, I will summarize what you have learned from the stereotype annotations section which

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,810
is a very important section in Spring core.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,360
You have learnt that instead of using the XML configuration, we can use the @Component annotation

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:23,620
to mark our java classes and Spring will automatically create the object of that particular class. To tell

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:31,100
the Spring container about the packages to scan for these classes marked with @Component annotation in

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,710
XML configuration,

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:41,970
we use the context:component-scan and we provide the base package which the Spring container will scan for

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,840
the beans marked with this particular annotation.

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,170
It will create the objects, does the dependency injection etc; It will scan this package as well as all

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,240
its sub packages for the classes.

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,480
And when we use stereotype annotation or annotations like @Component, we also use @Scope to

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,730
specify the scope of that particular bean which could be singleton, prototype, request, session etc.;

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,990
And to provide values or to inject values, we use the @Value annotation. We can inject primitive types and collection

14
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:26,810
types using the @Value annotation. And to inject the object types or reference types we use the

15
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,140
@Autowired annotation.
