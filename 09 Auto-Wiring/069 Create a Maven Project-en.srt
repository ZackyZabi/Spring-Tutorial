1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,570
To start working on the Spring auto-wire use case, let's first create a new maven project, because we have

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,320
put quite a few classes under this Spring core and also packages.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,350
It's getting overloaded or cluttered.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,580
So create a new project by going to the File menu.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,700
New -> Maven project, click Next. Leave the default option which is maven architect, click start, click Next.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:36,230
The group Id is com.bharath.spring which is fine, and the artifact Id should be springcoreadvanced.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,500
Finish, that will create the maven project for us.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,130
Open the pom.xml and close everything else. If you have other files open close them all. Click on the last tab

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,690
which says pom.xml. By default it will have the junit dependency.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:01,310
Let's add the spring dependencies by going to the pom.xml of the previous project. Open it, go to the

11
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,200
last tab, maximize.

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:12,200
Copy all the way from properties till the closing of build element. Come back to our new project's pom.

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:21,290
Start from properties, go all the way till dependencies, paste it, save it. We got the spring version as a property,

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,650
we have the two spring dependencies, the spring-core and spring-context, the jars that we need, and Maven

15
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:34,060
will pull all the other transitive dependencies. And in the plugin management, we have configured the maven

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,220
plugin compiler or maven-compiler-plugin.

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,880
And we are asking it to use Java version 1.8. By default, maven will use 1.5.

18
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,480
So we're asking it to use 1.8. Go to src/test/java.

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,740
We don't need junit, we are not using junit. So delete that package, OK.

20
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,940
Right click on the project. Since we have changed the maven pom.xml,

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,340
you have to right click, go to Maven, say Update Project, hit OK.

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,880
That will update the project and all the errors will go away.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,480
Now let's copy over the propertyplaceholder which we have here.

24
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,210
Copy over that package, Control+c, paste it under the source folder here, because propertyplaceholder

25
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,840
is also an advanced topic and let's delete it from the previous project. We'll have it only in one place.

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,130
That's it. Starting next lecture, you'll be working on Spring autowiring.
