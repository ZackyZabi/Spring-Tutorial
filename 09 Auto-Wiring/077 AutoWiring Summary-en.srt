In this lecture, I will quickly recap and summarize what you have learnt from the Autowiring section.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,070
Autowiring

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,430
is the process of the spring container automatically injecting the object types. Autowiring can

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,240
be done in two ways, using XML configuration and annotations. In XML configuration,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,400
we can do it byType, by the object type or the class type, byName,

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,030
that is the name of the object or bean in the XML configuration.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:40,090
And byConstructor. As the name itself says, byConstructor uses constructor dependency injection methodology

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:48,020
whereas byType and byName, when we use these two the spring container will use the setter injection.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,840
And the second and the most used way is using annotations.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,700
We can autowire by simply marking a particular dependency or a field on a class using @Autowired

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,290
annotation.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,240
And if there are multiple beans of the same type and if there is a confusion for the spring container,

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,740
we can use the @Qualifier annotation and tell the spring container which bean we exactly want to inject.

14
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,820
@Qualifier is always used along with @Autowired annotation.
