1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:09,330
An object A depends on object B to do its job, then B is the dependency and A is the dependent object.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,360
So far, you have learnt how to do dependency injection using the setter and constructor injection and

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,530
link up these two objects using the ref tag. As a programmer, you have configured the dependency injection

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,240
in the config.xml using the ref tag.

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,830
This process of linking the dependent and the dependency is called Wiring,

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,610
wiring of beans together. In realtime applications, you will be wiring a lot of objects or a lot of dependencies

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,400
together.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,100
If this process is done by the programmer, then it is called bean wiring.

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:52,910
And if this process is done by the container itself, the Spring container itself, then it is called auto wiring.

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,220
So we'll not be writing any ref tag, we will not be using the property tag or the constructor arg tag,

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,570
the container will do it for us.

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:10,200
Simply we configure it when we configure our beans to do autowiring. Autowiring can be done in two different

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,970
ways using XML. By default,

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,620
it is no, it is not autowired.

15
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:25,150
We can autowire by type, by the datatype, by name of the bean and also Auto detect is an other option which

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,520
only works in Spring 2.0x and lower. So auto detect is not there,

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,400
starting Spring 3.0 we'll not be using that.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,450
And finally, by constructor. Here by type and by name use the setter injection. By constructor, as the name

19
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,930
itself says it uses the constructor injection.

20
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,600
And also we can do autowiring through annotations.

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,520
We use the @Autowired annotation and @Qualifier annotation to do Autowiring. In the next few

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,400
lectures, you'll be using both these ways to autowire.
