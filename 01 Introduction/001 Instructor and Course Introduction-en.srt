00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello! And thanks for investing in the "Spring Framework in easy steps" course.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,900
This is Bharath Thippireddy. I'm a Java architect and instructor.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,500
I have been designing and developing enterprise Java applications for the last 13 years.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:22,700
And I'll be doing my best to help you make the maximum out of this course, by learning what Spring is,

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,000
why it is so popular in the Java EE application development world,

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,000
when to use it and you will also master all the important concepts such as dependency injection,

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,280
inversion of control, what a Spring container is, etc;

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,000
You'll then move on to see Dependency injection in action by injecting primitive types,

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,000
collection types as well as object or reference types.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,500
The Spring container maintains the complete lifecycle of an object.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,300
You will learn what that lifecycle is and how to use the three different ways to configure these lifecycle methods,

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,000
that is using XML configuration, Spring interfaces, as well as using annotations.

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,210
You will then use the dependency check to ensure that all the dependencies that we want

14
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:25,800
are being injected by Spring or provided at runtime. You'll define objects inside objects, that is, inner beans.

15
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,000
Spring creates objects based on their scope that we provide.

16
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,000
You'll try out the different scopes that Spring offers and those we can configure.

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,000
Based on the scopes Spring will create the objects at runtime.

18
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,600
Once you learn Setter injection, using Constructor injection is very straight-forward.

19
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:52,500
You'll do that in simple steps. Instead of hardcoding values in real time applications,

20
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:00,000
we use property files. You will learn how to read and use those properties in Spring beans.

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:07,940
Auto-wiring is a very powerful feature where Spring does all the dependency injection automatically.

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,100
You will master auto-wiring and use it across the projects throughout the course.

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:21,000
You will then learn how to reuse the collection types by using Standalone collections.

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:28,000
A second way to create objects in Spring is by using annotations.

25
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,000
You will learn all the stereotype annotations and also how to enable them.

26
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,100
Spring expression language provides a very easy syntax.

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,000
You will learn what expression language is and how to use it.

28
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:49,000
You will wrap up the Spring course section by using interfaces and their implementations for dependency injection.

29
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:59,000
You will see runtime polymorphism and runtime injection in action. You will then move on to the Spring JDBC module

30
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:09,000
which abstracts the JDBC API and makes it very easy for a developer to perform the CURD or CRUD operations, that is,

31
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:18,800
Create, Update, Read and Delete operations against a database. ORM stands for object relational mapping.

32
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,000
It converts a Java object into a database row and vice-versa.

33
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,000
You will use Spring with hibernate and see how it makes the life of a developer very easy.

34
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:39,000
It integrates very well with hibernate and in very simple steps we can do ORM, Object Relational Mapping.

35
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:48,500
Spring MVC is a complete implementation of the MVC pattern and can be used to develop web applications end to end.

36
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,000
You'll learn the various components that make up a Spring MVC application and the connection between them.

37
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:02,000
You will send the data from the controller to the UI and also from the view back to the controller.

38
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:12,920
You will then use your Spring dependency injection skills, Spring MVC skills as well as the ORM skills

39
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:20,000
and build a complete dynamic web application end to end. And in the process you will also learn,

40
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:28,000
briefly learn AJAX and make AJAX calls using JQuery. AJAX is a part of all the modern web applications.

41
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,000
Look at any web application and you will see a AJAX call.

42
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,100
So you are going to learn how to do that using JQuery.

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:44,000
AOP which stands for Aspect Oriented Programming allows us to add external services

44
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,000
to our business methods without modifying the code. So you are going to learn what AOP is,

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the key terminology in AOP and also create your own aspects and apply them.

46
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:03,000
Just like my other courses, this course is going to be Agile and an incremental course.

47
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,770
I'll be adding several other modules in Spring on a continuous basis.
