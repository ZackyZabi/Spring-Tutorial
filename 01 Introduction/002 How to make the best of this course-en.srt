00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to the "Spring Framework in easy steps" course.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:11,000
In this short lecture I will explain you how this course is organised, so that you can use it effectively.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:17,600
This course is divided into sections, and each section has short and to the point lectures.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:25,000
There will be quizzes at the end of each section for you to evaluate what you have learnt from that section.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,850
Consider 70% as a good score on these quizzes.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,600
I will also be adding several assignments which I suggest you work right away

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:43,000
as soon as you finish a section or a topic. The softwares that are required for this course are Java,

8
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:53,000
Apache Tomcat server, Eclipse IDE or an other IDE of your choice and the MySql database and workbench.

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:01,000
The setup of all these softwares is covered in easy steps in the very second section,

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,100
which I suggest you work on right away so that you will be ready when you reach the hands-on sections pretty soon.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:19,400
At any point if you have any questions, you can post a question on Udemy or you can send me a personal message.

12
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,000
And I will respond to them, usually pretty quickly.

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:31,500
You will learn all the fundamentals of Spring and also advanced topics and build applications end to end.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,000
But for that to really happen, you need to practise and work hands-on along with me.

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,000
Spring is huge, and when we build enterprise applications, we use parts of Spring framework.

16
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,200
I will be adding several new modules to the course on a continuous basis and also

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,000
I will be upgrading the existing ones as required.

18
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,800
Now get started, enjoy the course and remember,

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,700
that I am always here to listen to your feedback and respond to your questions.
