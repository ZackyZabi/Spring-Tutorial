00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,530
In this lecture, you will install Java 8 on your machine, to do that

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,480
You can download this development tool setup dot txt file from the content of this lecture on udemy

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,300
or you can simply google for the appropriate software.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,120
So the first link here is for Java 8.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,980
You can also get there using Google.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,750
Copy that link.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,660
Launch the web browser paste the link that will take us to the java 8 downloads page

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,070
scroll it down.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,330
And here we have the Java SE development kit,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,930
that is what we want we don't need their demos and sample downloads accept the license agreement and

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,670
for different operating systems.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,740
We have the appropiate JDK.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,300
So depending on the operating system you are working on if you are in Windows you will click on this

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,250
here for 64 bit and 32 bit and then for Mac you will click on the DMG and for Linux you will download

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,510
the tar.gz. Once you have the exe downloaded on windows double click on it and just follow

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,910
the prompts choose an appropriate folder on you c-drive or D-drive,

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,900
but do remember which folder you were installing Java as we needed later to configure the JDK in Eclipse

18
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,220
for Mac.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,210
It's pretty simple you double click on the DMG once you downloaded it and you will push it into

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,780
your applications.
