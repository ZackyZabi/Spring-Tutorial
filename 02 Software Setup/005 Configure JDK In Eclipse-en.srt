1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,620
In this lecture you will learn how to launch that Eclipse ID and configure a JDK in it, so click on Eclipse

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,310
icon

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,680
once you install it your version might be different.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,520
That's OK as long as it's one of the latest.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,090
You need to select a workspace, workspace is where all the projects you are going to create will be saved

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,740
into eclipse.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,130
We'll put all the projects into this folder, browser and you can select whatever folder you want on my Mac,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,770
I have it under documents workspace.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,940
You can create any folder on your cdrive or d drive and make it your workspace.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,900
hit OK.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:46,290
And that will launch eclipse if you are launching it for the first time you will see a different view.

12
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,640
Once you are on Eclipse you can close all those windows and we'll get here.

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,390
Eclipse has different perspectives java

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,030
EE Java exectra when you're developing a certain kind of project automatically those perspectives

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,630
will be switched.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:06,770
If not you can click click on them and switch as well to configure the JDK you need to tell eclipse

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:13,270
where the JDK is so that it can use it compile your classes and do the rest of it.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:22,430
So Windows preferences on a Windows machine you will see preferences under Windows preferences on Mac

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,100
will have go to the eclipse menu preferences once you are here

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,010
either its windows or Mac,

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,980
its all the same.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,870
So JRE type-in JRE

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,510
Click on installed JRE's by default.

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,350
Eclipse picks up the JRE installed on your machine.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,860
If you have one so Windows usually comes with a JRE under program files.

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,780
It would pick that up.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:57,680
If not if it has picked that up delete it by selecting it remove and add click on add select standard

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,100
V.M. next browse to wherever you have installed JDK on your machine and select that folder.

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:14,270
So in my case if I did this this is my JDK in your case if you are on Windows it will be C-Drive program

30
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,040
files Java or JDK 1.8 like this.

31
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,460
So just select that folder.

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:26,540
You don't need all this content slash home that is on Mac on Windows you can stop here right here are

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,490
JDK.

34
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,690
So you shouldn't select a JRE or JDK bin.

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,310
It should be the JDK folder.

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,520
So in this lecture you have lunched the eclipse ID selected workspace and also would have configured a JDK

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,320
that you how installed in the previous lectures for Eclipse to use.
