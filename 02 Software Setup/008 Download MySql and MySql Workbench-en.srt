00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,270
The database that you are going to use throughout this course is mysql which is a popular open source

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,350
data source database and also you will be installing mysql workbench and install mysql.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,910
Mysql workbench is a client which is GUI based tool which which we can launch connect to the mysql and execute our sql

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,360
statements. You are going to do it in three simple steps you will download the installer you will install

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:35,040
the mysql as well as mysql workbench and you will configure mysql although it sounds like a

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,900
lot of work it isn't.

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,640
Once you download the installer you just keep clicking on the next button and there are a couple of

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,890
things you need to do.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,790
You need to choose that you also need the workbench when you are installing.

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,830
And when you are in the configuration step you need to make sure that you enter a password it will

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,280
prompt you for entering a root password so that you can log in later on.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,250
Make sure that you give a simple password which you will remember.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,510
I will also give you a link which has very good instructions on how to install mysql search for my

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,710
sql install.

15
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,860
And scroll down.

16
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,170
There are many links but I found one of these very useful

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:28,440
which says Corley solutions dot com how to install mysql server 5.6 on Windows 7 development machine.

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,030
This works for different versions of Windows and Mac.

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,370
Click on that link and list out all the important steps to download.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,290
to install and to configure.

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,050
Again all these instructions are nothing but clicking on the next button.

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,410
Only if you have any issues you can come back here and refer to it in the very first step.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,570
you can click on the link here control click it and you will go to the mysql downloads page.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,490
Scroll down and select your operating system.

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,270
If you are on Windows select Microsoft Windows.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,840
I don't want you to download the zip files which are here click on this go to download page that will take

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,570
you to the MSI installer's and download one of these depending on your operating system once downloaded

28
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,010
double click on them and just keep clicking the next button.

29
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,130
Once the installation completes it will ask you if you want to configure the mysql server click on that

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,330
and that is where it will prompt you for a root password and make sure while installing you check the

31
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,690
workbench option as well so that you will have the bench installed as well and at the end of it, it will

32
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,350
be running as a Windows service automatically for you every time your machine restarts.

33
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,400
Mysql server will be up and running,

34
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,710
you can manage that by going to your Windows services.

35
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,950
Same on Mac on Mac as well.

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,970
It will boot up as soon as you mac starts and it will be up and running on a

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,890
port 3 3 0 6 by default.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,990
Please do not forget the password that you are entering during installation for me I use a password

39
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,510
called test So that will be easy to remember.
