1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,880
Hoping that your mysql installation has completed successfully you should have mysql up and running

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,480
and the mysql workbench installed on your machine to connect to connect to the my sql server

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:19,250
from mysql workbench launch the mysql workbench by clicking on a shortcut like this here

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,790
and that will launch the mysql workbench.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,660
You start by creating a new connection to the database click on this plus button will open up a pop up

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,350
By default the host name is my local machine.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:39,560
The default port for mysql server is 3306 and the user name is root.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,560
Give it a name.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,620
I'm going to call it local.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,660
That's my connection name.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,670
Click on test connection and it will prompt you for password.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,700
This is the password which you would have entered when you configure the mysql server So in my case it is test.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,190
Click OK and it says successfully made the mysql connection.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,080
OK.

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:02,940
OK.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,860
Again and it will be created.

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,970
You can now connect to the database by simply double clicking on this, it will open up the query window.

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,190
Since I have been using it I see all this but you can always create a new query window by going here.

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,010
New query tap.

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:29,140
And let's start by creating a database called my db to create a database create database.

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,380
My db

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:38,180
So is the name of the database select click on the lightning button here and that will create a database

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,880
