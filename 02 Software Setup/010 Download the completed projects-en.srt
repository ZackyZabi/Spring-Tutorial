1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,670
In this lecture I will show you how to download the completed maven projects that you will be developing

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,660
throughout this course.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,840
You can always compare your code and configuration with the code and configuration in these projects

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,720
if you are having any issues.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,890
Go to the resources section of this particular lecture on udemy that would be on the top left

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,910
corner.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,690
It will be prompting you saying there are available resources for this lecture.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,230
If you click on it you can download this spring projects dot zip file unzip the contents of it and

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,540
you will see all these projects.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,460
I'll be updating these contents as I add more sections in the future.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,950
For example if you go to Spring core you will find the source folder and the pom dot xml the maven

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:52,150
configuration file under the SRC we have the entire Java code as well as the spring configuration

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,680
in here so you can always compare your classes that use once you start working on the hands on lectures.

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,030
If you have any issues or any errors you can see what's wrong by comparing your code with the code inside

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,800
these projects.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:14,850
And if you want to import them into eclipse goto the eclipse IDE right click goto import click on import

17
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:24,390
here and type in existing Maven projects you should import them as existing Maven projects.

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:31,530
Next browse to that folder I have it under Documents spring projects Select a particular project

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,550
hit open.

20
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,090
I already have that project here that is the reason it's not enabled.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,790
But in your case if you don't have the spring core project in your Eclipse IDE you will see this enable

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,620
select it hit finish and that project will be imported into eclipse.

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,670
But I don't want you to use the ready made projects.

24
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,790
I want you to code along with me in parallel and only if you have any issues you should be referring to

25
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,600
these completed projects.
