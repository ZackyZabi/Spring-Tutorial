1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,410
In this lecture, you will configure a datasource for our application without writing a single line of XML

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:14,150
or java code. That's right! Spring boot allows us to pass in all that information through application.properties file.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,470
So go to src/main/resources,

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:25,050
open the application.properties and start adding four properties. spring.datasource and

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,690
STS will help you out and

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:35,060
fill it in, datasource.name is the first property, is equal to, give it a unique name.

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,910
Let's call it simply mydatabase.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,830
You can give any name. spring.datasource.url is the second parameter and you know what that

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,370
URL is.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:01:02,040
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb

11
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:12,630
The next two properties are spring.datasource.username=root

12
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,300
in my case. Even in your case I think it is root. datasource,

13
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,200
one last property, dot password is equal to test

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,470
in my case. That could be different in your case.

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,940
So you have successfully configured a datasource in application.properties. When our application starts up

16
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,100
Spring will read this file.

17
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,830
Let me take an extra '=' right there.
