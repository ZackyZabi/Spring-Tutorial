00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,840
In this lecture, you will learn how easy it is to create a Product repository interface which can perform

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,650
all the CRUD operations for us on the fly at runtime. Thanks to Spring data

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:22,860
JPA. So right click on src/main/java -> New. You will create an interface, call it ProductRepo.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,110
You can call it whatever you want.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:30,730
Usually this is a naming convention, you either call it ProductRepo or ProductRepository. And package

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,520
com.bharath.spring.data.repos. Click on Add.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,770
It needs to extend an interface from Spring. And search for CrudRepository.

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,460
Select this interface which allows us to perform CRUD operations on the fly.

9
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,350
Hit OK.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,810
Finish.

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,400
And the CrudRepository is a genetic repository, which can take a class. In this case,

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,170
it is Product.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,580
So if we have multiple entities in our application, we'll be creating multiple repositories, one for each

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,730
entity. And we'll be passing in the type of that entity here and the type of Id. In this case, the

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,700
Id on product is of type long.

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,870
So we are passing that information here.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,110
Control+1, import Product, because it is in a different package. That's it. Starting the next lecture,

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,810
we can write our test and perform CRUD operations.
