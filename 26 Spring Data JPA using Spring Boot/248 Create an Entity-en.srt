1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:08,220
We'll be creating an entity, a JPA entity in this lecture. For that we are going to use the Product table in

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,430
our database. Go to MySQL workbench. This is the same table which you would have used when you learnt hibernate

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,840
using Hibernate through Spring in earlier lectures. use mydb. If you do a select right now, I have cleaned up my Product

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,860
table, there are no records in the Product table.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,780
It has four columns, id, name, description and price.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm going to create an entity from scratch.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,990
You can copy the entity which you might have earlier from the hibernate lectures if you want to. Right click

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,490
on the package, say New -> Class, Product.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:52,750
This entity, JPA entity represents the database table. Put it in a package called data.entities.

10
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,540
Finish.

11
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,120
It has or it needs four properties.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:14,650
private Long id; private String name; private String description;

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,070
Let's see if that's exactly the name.

14
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,270
Yes, it is description and finally private Double price;

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,510
Generate getters and setters for these. Select them all, go to Source -> Generate Getters and Setters.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,360
Select All. Hit OK.

17
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:45,010
As of now, it is still just a bean. Grab the properties, put them in the right position. Control+x, take them

18
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,120
all the way up, paste them. Control+Shift+f to format. To make this an entity,

19
00:01:50,380 --> 00:02:01,300
you know what to do. Mark this class with @Entity annotation from JPA. Once it loads all the dependencies,

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,760
it's trying to figure out. javax.persistence,

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,750
that's the entity annotation and this with

22
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,970
@Id. Those are the only two annotations

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,890
we need. So we have successfully created an entity in this lecture. In the next one, you will create a Spring

24
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,580
repository, a repository interface that will extend an interface from Spring.
