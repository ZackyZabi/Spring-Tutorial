In the previous lectures, you have learnt how to read and inject properties into our beans.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,440
In this lecture, you will see what happens if we use a property that does not exist in the properties

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,980
file.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,630
Or we can also demonstrate it by using case insensitiveness.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,630
That is, go to your test,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:25,000
or go to the configuration and let's try to read dbserver. This property does not exist.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,460
Let's see what happens by running the test.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,240
And the exception is, if you scroll up it says invalid

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:43,210
bean definition, could not resolve a placeholder 'dbserver' in string value dbserver.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,910
So that's what Spring throws, a bean definition store exception. It could not find that particular property

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,290
or particular bean in the configuration or in the store.
