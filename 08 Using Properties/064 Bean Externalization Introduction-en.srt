00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,750
In this lecture, you will learn an advanced Springcore concept called Bean externalization or reading

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:14,340
properties from a file and injecting it into a bean. In realtime applications, we often have some properties

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,440
or key value pairs such as the db name, the port number of the server, usernames, passwords etc; which we

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,490
do not hardcode in our application code and use a properties file instead.

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,580
If we have to change these values, the values for these keys, we need not change it everywhere in the

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,070
code.

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,470
Simply we go to this one global property file and change the value right there.

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:47,990
And it can be reused without recompiling our application or code. In spring applications,

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,130
we use the property place holder configuration to link these property files with our xml configuration

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,170
in three steps.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,830
The first step,

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,020
we create the property file ofcourse.

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:07,550
The second step is to link this property file in our XML configuration and then we use that property

14
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:15,110
file and inject the values in this property file into our application, or we inject these properties

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,970
as dependencies to our beans.

16
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,070
In this lecture, you will create the property file and in the next lecture you will link it and test it.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:37,120
Go to Eclipse, right click, create -> New, go to other. Type in file. Select file, because we are going to create

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:49,850
a property file. Call it database.properties, Finish. We'll move it under a package in a second.

19
00:01:50,810 --> 00:02:05,160
Right click, new, create a test class. com.bharath.springcore.propertyplaceholder

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,860
is the package name, finish. Move this property file into that new package called propertyplaceholder.

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,070
Open it, add some properties to it.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,960
This will have a dbServer is equal to, let's say a bharathserver.

23
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,790
You can give a IP address if you want to.

24
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:40,690
dbPort=3306. Let's keep all camel case. dbServer, S capital, dbPort, P capital, dbUser, U capital, test.

25
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,160
dbPass is equal to test as well.

26
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,830
Save it.

27
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,190
So you have successfully created the dot property file. Both the keys and values

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:59,430
here are string type. And if we have duplicates, for example, if I add another dbPass here, always the

29
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,900
latest will be taken.

30
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,250
So the last one will be used. If you want to comment out something, you use hash. That means comment, in

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,540
a property file and that property will not be read.

32
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,510
Comments are useful to give information.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,600
For example, you can say #The default port etc;

34
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,670
Or if you have multiple configurations, if you have along with dbServer configuration if you have a

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,560
web service configuration here, you can say #web service configuration. That is the use of comments. And

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,880
these db properties here or any properties are case sensitive, the keys here are case sensitive. dbUser

37
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,190
is not the same as dbuser.

38
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,980
So you've got to be careful with the case as well.

39
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:54,020
In the next lecture, we'll link up these properties in our XML configuration and we'll inject them into

40
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,820
our bean. Uncomment everything

41
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,760
and you can delete this line, we'll have four properties.
