1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,970
In this lecture, you will implement the getProduct method that will return all the products in the database. We'll expose it

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,690
out as a RESTful API. To do that,

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:17,450
start with the public Iterable<Products>. So this method should return a iterable products.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,530
I will tell you why

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,000
an iterable. public Iterable<Product> getProducts()

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:34,530
and we have to use the repository interface in here. First import the product, control+1, Import 'Product',

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,950
Next, start using productRepository. control+space, take the ProductRepository. Call it repository.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,830
And mark it with

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,150
@Autowired annotation so that Spring will automatically inject this dependency for us. Then we can start

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,370
using it.

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:03,340
Copy the repository, go into your method, dot, findAll(). The repository has a findAll method that returns

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,690
all the products as a Iterable product.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,130
You can convert it into a list, etc if you want to.

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,570
But I am returning an Iterable<Product>. Spring will automatically convert this into JSON.

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,780
That magic happens for us automatically. So return repository.findAll();

16
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:30,060
So the default data format for spring RESTful web services is JSON, it configures the Jackson adapters and

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,490
all that automatically.

18
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,260
The next important piece, mark this method with @GetMapping. Control+space,

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,920
@GetMapping, because we want to use the clients, to use the GET method to get all the products.

20
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,470
So you should tell that by using the @GetMapping annotation. So you have successfully implemented it. In the

21
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,770
next lecture, we'll test if this particular endpoint works by using Postman.
