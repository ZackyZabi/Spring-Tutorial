1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,840
The second step is to create a RESTful controller class that will act as a endpoint to our RESTful application.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,520
To do that,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,410
go to STS.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:25,240
Right click on the src/main/java, New -> Class. Call it ProductController and put it in a package called

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:36,470
com.bharath.spring.controllers. Finish. Right now this is just a class. To make it Spring RESTful

6
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:44,890
controller, you have to mark it with @RestController annotation from springframework.web.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,160
So you have added the maven dependency in the last project which was spring-boot-starter-web.

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,450
That is where this annotation resides.

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,240
That is the number one step. And then we have to define a root path for our controller.

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,890
That is where our clients will be accessing our RESTful services. To do that you'll use @RequestMapping.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:20,950
Within double quotes, /products. That will be the URI that our clients will use to access this

12
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,240
particular controller and starting the next lecture,

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,980
you will define all the CRUD operations starting with getProduct.
