00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:10,810
In this lecture, you will implement the UPDATE method of the product for the RESTful API. So go to STS. And it's very simple

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:17,230
because you can copy the CREATE method, paste it and change this mapping to @

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,840
instead of PostMapping,

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,880
it should be PutMapping.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,100
You are going to use or our clients are going to use the PUT method. Change the method name to UPDATE. These

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,440
method names could be anything, the important piece is you are using the appropriate or the correct mappings

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,490
and bindings and the request and responses.

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,800
So the request will still be the entire product and we'll still be invoking repository.save. This save

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,720
method internally,

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,220
it knows whether a particular product is already there.

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,550
If it's there it will update that information instead of creating it by looking at the ID field in the

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:01,260
request and it returns that product back. Stop the application, start it again.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:10,350
While it starts, go to Postman, open up a new tab. Change the method to PUT. Grab the URL by going

14
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:22,240
to the previous tab. Come back, paste it. Go to Body, go to raw, change this to json.

15
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,460
You could have used the previous tab, but I just want you to go through this exercise if you are new to Postman.

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:37,800
And we are updating an id or a product with id 2. Change the price from 800 to 900.

17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,940
Send it and we get a 200 OK response. The id is still 2.

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,040
And the price has changed to 900.

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,880
You can go to the database and execute a select and the price has changed to 900.
