00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,240
The first step is to add the maven dependency for spring-boot-starter-web. To do that,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,100
go to STS, go to the springdatajpa project. Open up the pom.xml file, double click

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:22,140
to maximize. Go to the dependencies section and right below the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, you can

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:30,270
copy this dependency and paste it right next to it. Do a Control+shift+f to format, remove the spaces.

5
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,710
And the dependency we want is spring-boot-starter-web.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,250
We don't need the data-jpa. We already have it in here.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,730
So spring-boot-starter-web, that's all that is required.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,120
In the next lecture, you will start working on our Rest Controller.
