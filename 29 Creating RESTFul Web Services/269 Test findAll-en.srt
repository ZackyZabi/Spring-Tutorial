1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,860
Before we launch our application and test it,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:11,040
one small change is to move this SpringdatajpaApplication which is the starting point of our application,

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,000
to a package above it.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,470
That is, I don't want it to be in com.bharath.spring.data, because when we run our application automatically

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,310
Spring will

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,110
scan this particular package and all its subpackages. So it will not

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:34,030
scan our controllers package because controllers is not a subpackage of com.bharath.spring.data, but it

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,020
is a subpackage of com.bharath.spring.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,780
So let's move this to one level above.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,630
Get rid of data because now our project deals with Spring data as well as Spring REST or

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:52,960
Spring web. Delete that, hit control+1, move it to com.bharath.spring.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,970
Now we are good.

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:01,200
It should scan all the subpackages of com.bharath.spring. Launch our application. To do that, you can

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,830
right click, say Run As -> Spring Boot App.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,550
Since we have included the web dependency, it will automatically launch our application on the embedded

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,530
Tomcat server and it starts on localhost8080.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,510
And since we haven't mapped any web application route context, it will be localhost8080.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,380
We can access our application at that URL. So launch Postman, our REST client. By default it will be

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,520
a GET method.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,080
Start typing in the URL, localhost:8080/products.

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,600
That's the URL to access all the products.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,090
Hit Send.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,000
Click on that button and we get the one and only product we have in our database.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,610
You have multiple products, as you can see it is JSON array.

25
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,530
So you have successfully implemented and tested a RESTful application, just the GET part so far.

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,210
We will be implementing and testing the rest of the methods in the next few lectures.
