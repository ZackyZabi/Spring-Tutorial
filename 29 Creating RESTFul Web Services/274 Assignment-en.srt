00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,750
As an assignment, I want you to implement the deleteProduct method. Tha DELETE method will be very similar

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,000
to the find one. We'll be mapping it to a DeleteMapping with a HTTP delete method.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:20,240
It will take an ID, and you will bind it as a path variable and instead of calling the repository.findOne,

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,760
you should be calling repository.delete and pass in the ID. And the response should

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,690
be void. The DELETE operation will not return anything except for a 200.

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,980
So you need not return anything from your method.
