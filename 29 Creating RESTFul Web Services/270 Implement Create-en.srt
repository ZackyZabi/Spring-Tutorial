00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:08,070
In this lecture you will implement a product creation, the CREATE method by using the PostMapping. To do that,

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:17,840
start with a new method, public create() is the method. It takes a Product product and it returns the

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,120
created product.

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,460
And within the method, we'll be using repository.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,370
Rename this repository. I have spelled it wrong. If you have spelled it right,

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:43,310
you are awesome. Right click and I want to Refactor -> Rename it correctly. It's not respository, it should be

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,250
repository.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,610
For some reason it couldn't rename it. So I changed it to repository.save, is the method

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,770
we want and pass it the incoming product in the request that the client will send and return it back.

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,280
So whatever is saved to the database, we are returning it back. And here, this product, this request parameter

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,730
should be marked with @RequestBody, that tells spring that this parameter is being expected from

12
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:28,440
the RequestBody in the post body. Control+1, import RequestBody from Spring. And the next and the last

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,570
important piece, mark this method with the @PostMapping this time.

14
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,610
So for creation, we use a HTTP POST method.

15
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,860
So we are telling that this particular method is being binded to the HTTP POST method,

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,920
and in the incoming POST request we'll get the product details as JSON. Spring will automatically

17
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,030
convert that into this object.

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,830
And we are taking that object and saving it into the database. In the next lecture, we'll test

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,650
this POST method.
