00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,110
In the next few lectures, will be converting the springdatajpa project into a RESTful project. That is,

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:14,050
you will be allowing the end users to perform CRUD operations on the product using a RESTful API.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,080
You will do that in four simple steps.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,380
The first step is to add the spring-boot-starter-web maven dependency to our project.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,520
Second, you will create a RESTful controller using the appropriate annotations from Spring and then you

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,850
will implement all the CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE operations on the RESTful controller so that

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,160
our product can be created, read, updated and deleted using a RESTful API.
