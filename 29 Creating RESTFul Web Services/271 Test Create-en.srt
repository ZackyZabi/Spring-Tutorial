1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,490
In this lecture, we'll test our POST method. To do that,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,660
stop the server.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,520
It's already running, bring the app down and re-run it,

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,540
because we have made the code changes to implement CREATE. Once that's up,

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,890
go back to Postman. Click this plus button to open up a new tab. Go back to the previous tab,

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,790
grab the URL,

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,050
come back to the new tab, paste it.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,090
Change this HTTP method from GET to POST. From the dropdown you can see all the HTTP methods here.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:44,350
Click on Body, because we need to pass in the JSON in the POST request body, and select this raw.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,000
Change the content type from text to application/json.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,250
Go back to the previous tab and copy the contents of just the product.

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,780
No need of copying the square brackets, just from the starting flower bracket to the end up the brace.

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,230
Copy it, comeback.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,750
Paste the contents.

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:12,880
Change the id to 2, name to IPhone and it's awesome,

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,580
atleast for me. And the price is $800.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,750
So we are creating a new product with a new ID and everything. Click on Send and that should create

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,450
a product and in response we get that product back and the status is 200 OK.

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,490
To verify it, you can always go to your database.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,550
And select * from product, and you should see two products.
