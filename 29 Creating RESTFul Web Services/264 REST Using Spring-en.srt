Creating RESTful web applications is very easy using Spring because you need not learn a new module.

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:14,010
You will be using the Spring MVC or the Spring WEB module to create a web application. And to create a RESTful

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,300
endpoint, we'll create a Controller class and mark it with

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,690
@RestController. Instead of simple Controller which you used to mark when you worked on the web applications,

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,370
here you'll mark it with @RestController annotation. And to map it to a path, you'll use @RequestMapping

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,860
which you are already aware of, from Spring Web.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,570
And once you have the controller in place, this is your RESTful endpoint, and you can define as many

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,640
methods as you want in the controller

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,230
for your RESTful web service to serve.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,020
And each of these methods will be marked with the appropriate annotation.

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,100
Each of these annotations bind your java methods to a incoming HTTP method from the client.

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,810
You can use a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and so on. For each of the HTTP methods, there is a annotation from

13
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,310
Spring that you can use.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,350
So it's that simple.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,680
You'll define a controller, mark it with @RestController annotation, give it a path and then you can define

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,410
as many number of methods you want, you can define

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,920
paths, relative paths to

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:25,310
your methods and also bind them to the HTTP methods using these annotations.
