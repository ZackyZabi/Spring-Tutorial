00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,930
In this lecture I'm going to very briefly introduce you to a.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,330
I'm going to explain just that piece which is required for this course.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,750
Remember that this is not a Jew equity course.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,590
So J.A.G. is a javascript framework which makes the life offer quite easy to use javascript.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:27,600
It isn't laya or javascript and everything in equity starts with a dollar symbol it hides a lot of things

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,820
that we could do in Javascript.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,900
And it does the work for us automatically we simply use the dollar symbol and perform a lot of operations

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,760
for example.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,540
To access a field called user id in HDMI within javascript core we might have to write this much but

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:52,110
using J.A.G. it becomes very simple dollar within Doublecross within braces use that poem and use that

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,610
ID and will be able to access the user id field.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,710
This is a very small example there are many other things which we can do using J.A.G. in very simple

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,650
manner and to perform an AJAX call using J.A.G. again it simplifies a lot of things for us.

14
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,230
We need not use the javascript code and function calls.

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,600
We simply use the daughter symbol dot.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,390
Ajax is the function and within which we give it you are l.

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:27,280
So what we will do for that particular request at a particular function for a particular task.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,050
Basically what we want to do we have a model and then we provide the data that needs to be sent as a

19
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,240
part of that AJAX call.

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,510
This data is sent as key value pairs within braces.

21
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,030
This is also called Jason javascript object notation.

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,220
And finally the third and last parameter is success colon function which is right.

23
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,960
It is a callback function and the response comes back for this call and response comes back at some

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,810
point from the server.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,850
This function will be called on whatever code you write inside it will be executed.

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,900
To summarize equity is an abstraction but what step it makes our life as it don't appear very easy to

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,700
use as easy syntax to use instead of better using the javascript syntax.

28
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:25,020
You can implement it using javascript and to make it Ajax call we need to pass in three parameters to

29
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,080
the Ajax caught in J.A.G. API.

30
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:35,460
You want to hit that data or to send that callback function which will be invoked when the response

31
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,140
comes back.
