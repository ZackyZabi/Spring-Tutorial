00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,900
In the next few lectures you are going to use and make an object's call to the controller to do a validation

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,750
of this ID field.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,220
Every time a user enters their ID and he moves to another next field.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:20,120
Here we are going to validate to make sure that ID doesn't exist in the database already.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,360
Are going to do that using two simple steps.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,120
The first step is to create the backend cord.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,740
There is the down layer which will check if there a card exists in the database with the given ID then

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,130
the Soviets layer then the controller.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,890
This controller will be used or called Indu from the UI through an AJAX call.

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:51,930
We'll use the J.A.G. in our days page will include that library then we will handle the onchange event

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,550
in our days javascript core will make the AJAX call to the controller.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,420
And finally will handle the response if the ID exists in the database then we will display the error

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,040
message.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,590
If not we will not display any message to the end user.

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,520
That is the validation is successful.
