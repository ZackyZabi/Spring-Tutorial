1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,310
In this lecture you will make the AJAX call.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:12,270
So we didn't function on change and the user moves from the here from when he changes to another field.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,540
We want to handle that event that is exactly what we did here and within the Bartie use dollar d'arte

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,950
Ajax is the function name within J.A.G. that we can use to make it Zak's called open bracket.

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,550
And for Ajax as I said earlier we need to pass in three parameters within flower racquets this AJAX

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:47,350
call ends right here and a semi-colon and the ex-colonies you waddle

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:01:00,110
in you or at least if you remember from the controller validate email is that you will go back to use

8
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:06,230
a controller and the new method that you ought to have used that you or I use validate email that is

9
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,800
exactly what we should use in the user rage.

10
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:20,510
Daughter JCP That's number one second is data data and we need to provide the data that Windflower brackets.

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,630
Eat ID or you can call it id that is what we have mapped it to on the server side in the controller

12
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:37,350
using a request from the colon to get the value of this particular field here dynamically within javascript.

13
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:44,040
We need not to document target element and all that we can use the J.A.G. syntax dollar but then flower

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,480
brackets hash ID within double courts.

15
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:04,160
And outside of the of racket outside the dollar within brackets it's not allowed rackets dollar within

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,410
brackets use hash ID dot value.

17
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:15,410
So anytime you want X or Y to get Steimle field using the use daughter and it id using the pollen symbol

18
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,230
within double court and then you can either handle the events or get the value of it.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,870
In this case we are getting the value and passing it to the server side using the AJAX call and this

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,270
value here is a function blows it right there karma.

21
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,500
Each of these should we be limited with a comma you all call our data comma.

22
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,070
The last one is success.

23
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:49,170
If it is successful call then we need to write a callback function for Jacques's this callback function

24
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,020
will be called when the response comes back from the server.

25
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,740
So a function always there will be a response.

26
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,850
We know that this function will return a response text so that should be included here and within the

27
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,020
body of that function we are going to court our logic will do that in the next lecture.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,380
So so far you have handled the index events are how to handle the Dallas trip events for the ID field

29
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:22,190
and how made the AJAX call the next lecture will call this function which will display the error response

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,950
arm nothing to the end user.
