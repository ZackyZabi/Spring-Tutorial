1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,930
These attacks and the equity section you have learned that Ajax stands for synchronous javascript and

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,050
XML.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,450
It allows us to build responsive web sites by the end user to send in multiple requests instead of him

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,720
sending one single request and waiting for the response to come back.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,100
It's engro less communication.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,450
Second we have also learned that Jay queery is a javascript library that uses Javascript internally

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,480
but it provides abstraction and makes it easy for you I don't oppose to use javascript.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,680
It provides easy to use syntax.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,360
You have performed at Ajax call you it Ajax call into spring and we see the publication from the browser

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,340
using J.A.G. syntax $ Ajax.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,090
It required three parameters are data namely you order of that.

12
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,310
So what are the application data that has to be sent to the.

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,130
So what.

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,940
And finally a callback function and the response comes back we need to provide a callback function that

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,550
will be invoked.

16
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,280
So how successfully performed FDX call using J.A.G. and spring NBC.
