1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
In this lecture We'll work on the first step.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,430
That is partially we'll implement that Dow method.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,570
And so it's a Slayer method to fetch a user with a given ID.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
So when a user enters ID here we are going to make a call to the server side.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,920
So we need a method in the Dow that will dig that ID and check if our database record exists with that

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,250
given ID here.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,420
So go to that Dow Plus in our application stop the server before you do that because it's going to reload

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,740
it every time we change and save something or do the user be able the new method will return a user

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,520
back.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:53,510
It's called Find user on single user with that given ID integer ID or to use a Dow impel and implement

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,410
that he'd control one or the unimplemented amateurs.

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,550
They need that to do.

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,680
And you know how to load one single user if you remember from the Autumn section we use the hibernate

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,370
template.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,610
Dot Net is the matter and you pass it the entity class and the ID

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,350
entity class is user got class and ID is what comes in as that parameter.

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,970
And our third has been implemented in the area.

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:36,370
Now go to the services layer use the service or do the interface user it returns a user back get user

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,230
is the method.

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,980
And it takes the picture ID.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,810
The user service impulse control one of the unimplemented amateur's the lead the Tulu and return whatever

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,880
that doubt returns.

23
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,290
Dow d'arte find use it and pass in the ID.

24
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,640
Thats it.

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,280
So in this letter we have successfully implemented the dollar as well as the so we just need to find

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,890
Ifat use that exists in that database with a given ID in the next lecture we will implement the controller

27
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,770
method.
