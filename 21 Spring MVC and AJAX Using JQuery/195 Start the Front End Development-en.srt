1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,630
In this lecture we will implement the front end for our use case by following these simple steps.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,460
First we'll go to our Facebook page and include the J.A.G. library so that we can use the equity in

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,500
our application to do that.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,350
Go to clips go to the user rage darte dispute is under webapp.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:33,200
Was the rage not be open that open up your Chrome web browser and Google for J.A.G. example J.A.G. example.

6
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,680
Click on any of the links I'm going to click on this very first link.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,620
I'm W3 schools.

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,070
Scroll down click on any of these examples here.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,390
We are not going to use the example code.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,810
All we need is this clip block here.

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,570
What you see here.

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,310
Copy that and typescript.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,960
BLOCK This is to include the J.A.G. library which is available at this help in our page.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:07,090
Go back to Eclipse and it should be included inside the header block added after this matter.

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,300
Or you can also added after that title that you want but it should be within the header block.

16
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,490
So we have successfully included the Equity Library.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,510
Next if you see here we create one more script block and start writing all over the J record inside

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,240
it.

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:34,220
So go back to eclipse create script block and within that script block it just query function or record.

20
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,070
Always starts with dollar symbol within brackets.

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:55,380
Document Daut ready Dotty's outside the brackets dot ready within brackets function.

22
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,790
So this is an anonymous function that we are creating when the document is loaded completely into the

23
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,800
web browser.

24
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,120
We want to execute the following anonymous function and within that function

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:24,690
Let's close this right here with the semi-colon and within that function we are going to check on Change

26
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,640
event or handle the onchange event for this particular field.

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,960
Here so everything in J.A.G. and nowadays even in normal Dallas script we don't deal with names of these

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,400
fields.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,900
We should be able to hit Steimle field will have an ID ID is equal to ID.

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,770
In this case you can call it user ID as well but I'm going to use it as ID and will use this ID inside

31
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,540
the J equerry function dollar.

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:01,220
Is the syntax within the brackets within double chords hash ID.

33
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:08,140
That is how we can access a hasty field by using dollar for a query and within double quotes hash or

34
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,480
the poncey month and then followed by the hits DML fields ID Daut change.

35
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,720
I want to handle the onchange you in d'arte change within brackets.

36
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,080
Again function.

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,340
So everything in Javascript is a function.

38
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,340
And here we are providing anonymous functions and the document is loaded.

39
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,010
This is the function that should be executed within that function when on Change happens on a field

40
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,940
called ID.

41
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:46,550
We are creating another anonymous function starts there and ends right there with the Florida race and

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,970
a semicolon at the end.

43
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,900
So in this letter we have successfully used the J.A.G. library.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,410
You have also handle the ready event when the document is loaded in the browser.

45
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,550
You said this is the function that should be executed and within that function we also handle the onchange

46
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:13,270
event for this ID field in the next lecture will start making the AJAX call by using dollar got Ajax

47
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,450
from Chiqui.
