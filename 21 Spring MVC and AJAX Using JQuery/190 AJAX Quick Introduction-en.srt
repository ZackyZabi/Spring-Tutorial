00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,470
This and the next lecture I will introduce you to Ajax.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:12,460
And Jake very very briefly that jack stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,170
Do I understand Ajax.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:21,300
We need to know the race in which plane communicates to the application running on a server.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,520
So when I claimed access as a web application from his browser the communication could be synchronous

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,480
or asynchronous in synchronous the plane sensing their request and wait for the response to come back

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,850
until the response comes back from the application running on the server.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,830
He will not be able to pick and either action on the browser.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,250
He just needs to wait and the response comes back he can send the next request by clicking on a button

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,970
or by accessing it you are learn about the speech.

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,570
And then the response comes back.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,080
So here is a request response cycle is where everything is in sync.

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,780
That is why it is called synchronous communication.

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:08,170
As a result the end user needs to wait quite a bit and he can do anything else when he sends in a request.

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:16,280
That is where I think honest communication with is possible using AJAX comes in and using AJAX that

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,420
plane from there you like and Sandomir request question he need not wait for the response to come back

17
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,000
he can send in multiple requests and the responses will come back.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,140
It's Incra honestly at some point later as a result he can perform something on the way instead of just

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,730
waiting.

20
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:37,100
It is very powerful especially when our web pages how multiple things on the way.

21
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,880
Each of these components can be updated asynchronously.

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,580
So the end user will see something happening on the page and the responsiveness of our application to

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,280
the end user increases.

24
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,100
Then we use AJAX.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,820
Let's take a look at a very simple realtime example.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:02,870
Go to your web browser go to Google dot com and search for Google sign up you would already use to the

27
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,320
screen.

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,770
Click on the very first link which says Create your Google account.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,980
This is the sign up page where you need to enter your details.

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:19,460
Let's say X Y Z ABC Budig an entry or name but tells you what a username I'm going to type.

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,780
But this is where asynchronous communication with the server is going to happen.

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:32,070
I type parrot and I tabel or as soon as I tab to create a password as soon as onchange happens.

33
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,160
Here you see error message.

34
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,850
So from this page and ajax call has been made to the Google's application and it checks if this is I

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,390
mean it's already there in the Google database if it exists it is sending back an error message card

36
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,940
that username is the account.

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,410
So using AJAX we can perform AJAX calls and update partial ways in our application instead of submitting

38
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,160
the end form at the end after filling in everything and then the user seeing a message here we can see

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,070
it right away as soon as he piped in goes to the next will.

40
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,180
The validation has happened by making AJAX call all the way to the server to the database and he's able

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,540
to do the response right away.

42
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,280
So that is where Ajax is very powerful it improves the responsiveness of our web application in the

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,100
next few lectures.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,100
You will be making a similar AJAX call using Jacqui.
