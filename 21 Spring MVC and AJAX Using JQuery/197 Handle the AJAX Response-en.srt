00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,870
In this lecture We'll wrap up our courting by displaying the message whatever comes back from the AJAX

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,550
call.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:15,030
So go to the Ajax function and we need to display an error message right next to this ID field so we

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:23,030
can add s pan here Hatcham else pan and give it a unique ID IDs equal to within double chords.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,740
E r r MSEE for error message.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:35,440
We'll use that here will accept using J.A.G. dollar that in brackets double courts palm symbol passing

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,640
the 80 which is error message.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,390
E r r capital M S G dot next we the same text.

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,340
It is the text function and pass in whatever response text comes back from the validation.

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,360
Initially it would be blank.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,170
The span doesn't have anything.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,840
We are dynamically assigning Whatever comes back in the response to it.

13
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,840
And also not just sending the text.

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,980
We also want to do a little more work on the UI if response text is not equal to blank.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,470
Then I want the focus to be back on this particular field here.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,420
So the user enters something.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,770
He tab's over to name and the validation happens.

18
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,400
And if the validation feels I want the focus back to this particular field so that he can change it

19
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:42,470
to do that we can use the equity again dollar within brackets within double course hash.

20
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,490
The name of the field is ID

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:54,760
dot focus is the function and that will put the focus back on the ID field.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,180
So we have successfully completed our courting of the front end as well.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,310
We have done three things you know handle the document don't really change and made the ADX call and

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,890
we have provided a callback function within which you are taking the error message and displaying it

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,370
on to the UI by creating a hasty XML span.
