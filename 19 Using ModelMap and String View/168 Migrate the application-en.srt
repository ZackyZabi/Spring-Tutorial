1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,490
In this lecture, you will see how simpler the code will become

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:10,800
once we start using the ModelMap and string to return a ViewName instead of ModelAndView. To do that, go

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,370
to the UserController,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,610
the usecase that we have worked on earlier, that is the user registration usecase. Open up the UserController,

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,210
the very first method, all it does is return a view back but it is creating a ModelAndView object to

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,870
do that.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:36,650
Let's change that to string. Get rid of the first two lines and simply return, within double quotes, userReg,

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,280
r capital, that's that. We need not create a ModelAndView object at all.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,400
So that's simple.

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,980
Now the code is much better and cleaner.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:54,110
The second method takes a model attribute, that is whatever comes from the HTML form. Again it creates

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,440
a ModelAndView.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,290
So get rid of ModelAndView. Instead return the view first. Within double quotes,

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,300
regResult is the view. Change the return type to string.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,480
So we are done with the view portion.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:18,310
Now for the model portion, we need to use the ModelMap. We need to define the ModelMap as a parameter.

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,180
ModelMap from spring, call it model.

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,470
model.addAttribute, use that method.

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,320
Whatever you are adding here to the ModelAndView, do that on the ModelMap.

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,780
User comma user.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,610
Format it.

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,670
Get rid of the ModelAndView, we don't need it anymore.

23
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:56,300
Now the code is much simpler and cleaner because we don't use ModelMap. Do a control+shift+o to organize

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,620
the imports, control+shift+o. Let's rerun the application and see if everything works as expected.

25
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,240
Right click, run as -> run on server, finish.

26
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,710
My Tomcat is not running, so it will start it.

27
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,580
If you have it up on running it will restart it.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,260
The very first page is the registration page.

29
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,680
So copy that URL, come to spring MVC, paste it, Enter. So it goes to the first page, the first method

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,750
has worked.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,150
You have simply returned a string as a view and the Spring container has sent it to that particular

32
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,650
view.

33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:44,260
Go back, give it an id 123, Bharath, bharath@gmail.com. Submit and the second method

34
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,950
works as well,

35
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,470
just like how it was working before but the code is now much simpler and cleaner.
