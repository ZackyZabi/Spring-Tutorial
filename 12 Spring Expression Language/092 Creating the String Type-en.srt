00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,290
In this lecture, you will learn how to use string types within an expression.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,760
So let's assign some value or inject some value into this name here using expressions. Start

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:19,510
with pound within flower brackets, inside the quotes everything should be inside the double quotes, pound followed

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:26,580
by flower brackets and the string should go into single quotes because we have already used the double

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,630
quotes outside here, to assign the value.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,810
So we shouldn't be using double quotes again in the expression, we can use single quotes to do that.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,260
Let's see if this Bharath Thippireddy still gets injected into this name.

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,620
Run the test.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,540
And we still see Bharath Thippireddy.

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,400
So using expression language you have successfully injected a string. To invoke methods on the string,

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:00,420
you can simply use dot toUpperCase. You don't get any help from the IDE because you're doing it inside

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,740
double quotes. So you need to know the method names to invoke.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:14,700
You can go to test. You can invoke a method on new String().toUpperCase, it's camel case.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,760
So just to confirm that we are using the right method toUpperCase. Come back to Instructor and use

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,260
it. Save it, run the test again and everything

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,080
now in the name is uppercase. We can also create a string using the new operator.

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,470
Get rid of this within flower brackets.

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:45,030
We can use new, but we have to use the, give the complete class name, java.lang.String(), within

19
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:55,580
brackets double quotes, sorry, single quotes. We can't use double quotes in expression language. Bharath Thippireddy,

20
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,530
because we are using double quotes outside. So the compiler will be confused.

21
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,850
Save it. Run the test again and we are back to Bharath Thippireddy.

22
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:14,170
So in this lecture, you have learnt how to use expressions with string values, you have used the new operator.

23
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,840
You have used the string directly within single quotes, as well as you have seen that you can invoke methods

24
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,340
on the string type.
