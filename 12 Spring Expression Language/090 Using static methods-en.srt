00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,900
In the previous lecture, you have learnt how to use the expression language of Spring to inject an integer

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,180
value by evaluating a expression.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,160
In this lecture, you will learn how to inject or how to invoke static methods inside the expression. To do that,

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,530
we can use an integer negative value here. For example -99.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,300
Save it, run the test.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,010
And ofcourse 99, -99 and will be injected.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,360
To convert this -99 into a positive value. I always want the Id to be positive. To do that,

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:43,090
we can use the static method from Math class. java.lang.math.abs is the method.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:51,730
But to invoke a static method inside expression, here is the syntax. We should use T. Within the brackets,

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,240
the name of the class dot the static method name and any parameters we want to pass.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,870
So it should always start with a T.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,940
Let's use it. Inside the flower brackets,

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,750
start with a capital T, within brackets,

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,410
we specify the type, the java.lang.math.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,500
We need to give the complete class name dot abs.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,310
Absolute is the method and close the brackets.

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,600
-99 is the parameter that we are passing to the static abs method for absolute

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,910
inside the class java.lang.math. We use the class name to invoke a static method.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,750
But in case of expression language, we use an additional T. Within the brackets,

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,220
the name of the class will go, dot the method name and then the parameters if any.

21
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,410
Let's rerun the test and this time you will see a 99 and not -99.

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,380
So in this lecture, you have successfully learnt the syntax for invoking a static method inside an expression

23
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,140
starting with T, the class name within brackets, dot the method name and then the parameters.
