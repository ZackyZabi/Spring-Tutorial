The use case that you'll be working on to inject reference types is student and his test scores will

1
00:06.780 --> 00:14.100
create a student class which in turn depends or uses a class called scores which will have all the students

2
00:14.100 --> 00:18.050
scores in math physics and chemistry.

3
00:18.150 --> 00:26.090
So let's do the first step go to eclipse you know what the first step is new class

4
00:26.730 --> 00:33.770
in this case we are going to create two pojos or two spring beans the student and the scores start with

5
00:33.780 --> 00:45.000
student package com dot bharath dot spring  core dot ref types REF types finish and this student

6
00:45.780 --> 00:49.260
needs a class called scores private scores

7
00:49.260 --> 00:53.580
this class doesn't even exist scores

8
00:56.190 --> 01:01.090
hit control one create class called scores finish

9
01:04.010 --> 01:05.630
scores will have three fields.

10
01:05.630 --> 01:19.360
private double maths private double physics and finally  private Double chemistry the scores in chemistry

11
01:22.650 --> 01:23.810
select

12
01:23.960 --> 01:26.400
right click go to source

13
01:26.480 --> 01:30.230
It is also a shortcut for it generate getters and setters.

14
01:30.380 --> 01:32.940
Select all hit OK.

15
01:33.110 --> 01:37.400
do a control shift F to format if you want to move these up.

16
01:37.460 --> 01:43.700
You can hold the alt key select them hold the alt key press the up arrow so that the fields will be

17
01:43.700 --> 01:50.490
moved to the top control shift F to format go back to student.

18
01:50.540 --> 01:51.110
Save it.

19
01:51.110 --> 01:55.140
Hit control 1 we need to generate the getters and setters for the scores as well.

20
01:55.170 --> 01:58.350
So create get a sense that is it OK.

21
01:58.800 --> 02:06.280
And we have successfully created both the beans and in  the next lecture will do the spring configuration

22
02:06.390 --> 02:08.070
and also write the test class.
