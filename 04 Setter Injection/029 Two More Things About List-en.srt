1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,610
Before we wrap up the list topic you will learn a couple more things about the list element in the spring

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,870
configuration. If you want to configure a empty list without any values

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,910
We can do that.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,590
We can get rid of all the values from here.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,560
Save it rerun the test.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,390
Just click on the play button and the result is an empty list.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,550
There is no list that is being displayed anymore.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,930
So let's do that sys out

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:36,980
hospital dot get departments save it rerun and the list is empty.

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,850
So you can create a instance of a list by simply defining the list element without any values.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,620
We are controls that bring the elements back.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:52,160
One other thing you want to learn is if you have only one value inside the list then this list element becomes

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,910
optional.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,340
Spring is intelligent enough to create a list and inject this into that list or add this to that list

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,830
and then it will automatically inject it into the object.

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,770
Let's rerun the test.

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,860
Hit the play button.

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,960
Here is our list.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,600
It's not a single element but it is a list and it is injecting it into it.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,530
Even though we didn't use the list element inside our configuration do a control Z.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,390
So we have learned two additonal things.

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,630
One is if there is only one element in the list then this list element is optional.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,540
And also you can create a empty list by getting rid of these values.
