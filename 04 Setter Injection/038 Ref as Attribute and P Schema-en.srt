00:00.400 --> 00:05.170
When you injected the reference type you have used the ref as element.

1
00:05.210 --> 00:12.190
They can also be used as an attribute if you learn how to do that in this lecture and more to use ref 

2
00:12.340 --> 00:13.220
as an attribute

3
00:13.270 --> 00:18.670
You will start using it inside the property as an attribute there is a ref attribute on that element

4
00:18.730 --> 00:20.580
is equal to scores

5
00:20.770 --> 00:26.190
And then we can end that element right here and get rid of these two.

6
00:26.190 --> 00:34.010
We don't need the end tag this is how we can use ref as attribute instead of element run it

7
00:34.040 --> 00:37.560
run the test again and the output still remains the same.

8
00:37.560 --> 00:44.430
The score object is created and it is injected into students.

9
00:44.440 --> 00:46.730
Now let's learn another way of doing it.

10
00:46.730 --> 00:51.320
The P schema way you have used P schema to inject primitive types

11
00:51.390 --> 00:56.030
So for now you're going to learn how to inject the reference type as well.

12
00:56.030 --> 01:05.390
So right on bean here the student bean use P colon the syntax is variable name hyphen ref.

13
01:05.420 --> 01:12.960
So the variable name on the student is scores so will have to use variable name which is scores

14
01:13.070 --> 01:13.580
hyphen

15
01:13.580 --> 01:15.710
We need to tell that it is a reference type.

16
01:15.800 --> 01:23.060
We do that using a ref is equal to within double quotes the name of the bean or the reference of the

17
01:23.060 --> 01:30.950
bean which is scores then we don't need all this get rid of that and we can close the bean tag right

18
01:31.040 --> 01:31.650
there.

19
01:31.730 --> 01:38.040
save it rerun the test and the output still remains the same.

20
01:38.040 --> 01:44.070
So we have successfully learnt all the three ways of injecting reference type that is using a reference

21
01:44.780 --> 01:52.030
as element using ref as an attribute and also using the P schema to inject reference types.
