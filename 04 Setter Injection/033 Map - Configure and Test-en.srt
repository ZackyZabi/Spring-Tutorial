00:00.420 --> 00:05.670
In this lecture you will create the spring configuration which is the second step and also the Test class

1
00:05.910 --> 00:07.360
and run it.

2
00:07.420 --> 00:13.300
So let's get started by copying the configuration file config dot xml grab any of the earlier ones paste it

3
00:13.390 --> 00:16.750
in the map package grab the test from set or list.

4
00:16.960 --> 00:24.750
paste it open up the test we don't have the car dealer in this case we are going to deal with the customer

5
00:24.750 --> 00:25.170
objects

6
00:25.170 --> 00:29.700
so let's update the test first and we'll come back to xml configuration customer on the left

7
00:29.700 --> 00:31.620
hand side also its customer

8
00:31.800 --> 00:38.880
and we are going to name the bean inside spring configuration as a customer when we create it save that

9
00:39.680 --> 00:45.620
and instead of doing or invoking the getter methods we can simply display the customer

10
00:46.020 --> 00:50.930
So here instead of this it's going to be customer get rid of the second sys out

11
00:51.030 --> 00:56.430
Now that we have the two string method on the customer class the two string method will be invoked and the

12
00:56.430 --> 00:58.310
details should be displayed

13
00:58.770 --> 01:00.640
change this package name here

14
01:01.170 --> 01:11.240
to spring core slash map slash config dot xml

15
01:11.260 --> 01:13.780
The next step is to come up with the configuration.

16
01:13.810 --> 01:23.950
Open the config dot xml maximize the name of the bean is customer class name spring 

17
01:24.020 --> 01:25.020
Spring core.

18
01:25.150 --> 01:27.150
Dot map dot

19
01:30.020 --> 01:32.620
customer.

20
01:33.110 --> 01:36.080
We can use the piece schema for assigning the ID.

21
01:36.130 --> 01:42.320
We have an ID field on the customer as well so we can leave it as it is.

22
01:43.310 --> 01:44.460
But it doesn't end there.

23
01:44.460 --> 01:49.660
We have more slash bean ends there within the bean.

24
01:49.910 --> 01:59.440
We have the property name is products go to customer and the products is the name of the property.

25
01:59.730 --> 02:13.410
Come back paste it within the property we'll use map and map is where we define entries entry key

26
02:13.710 --> 02:22.120
is equal to hundred and value is equal to iPhone.

27
02:22.140 --> 02:25.870
Let's start with that.

28
02:25.990 --> 02:35.030
So here we are we have defined a map entry which has both the key as well as value as attributes.

29
02:35.830 --> 02:39.340
So this is a way where we are defining the key and value as attributes.

30
02:39.340 --> 02:41.500
There are different ways of defining it.

31
02:41.500 --> 02:51.940
lets try the second type entry value is equal to or let's start with key, key is equal to within double

32
02:51.940 --> 02:54.810
quotes 200.

33
02:55.110 --> 03:01.820
And instead of defining the value as an attribute I'm going to define the value as the element value

34
03:03.120 --> 03:07.790
is IPad That's the second variation.

35
03:07.800 --> 03:14.160
The third variation is entry value is equal to

36
03:18.400 --> 03:20.590
Mac Book Pro

37
03:24.990 --> 03:26.840
and key

38
03:27.540 --> 03:33.020
I'm going to define the key element and the value as an attribute this is the third combination.

39
03:33.180 --> 03:35.840
So these are all different ways of defining the entries.

40
03:35.840 --> 03:42.540
You are welcome to do all the entries in this format or this format or any format you like but you have

41
03:42.540 --> 03:54.580
the choice key value is equal to 300 in the last combination of course entry is where we define

42
03:54.580 --> 04:04.230
both as elements both the key and value as elements key is 400.

43
04:04.350 --> 04:11.330
Of course I need to define a value I can just define the key as it is key has a sub element called value

44
04:16.680 --> 04:20.080
control X do a control shift F  to format

45
04:22.670 --> 04:30.700
save it and the value is MacBook Air

46
04:34.870 --> 04:35.850
save it.

47
04:35.930 --> 04:41.120
So we have successfully defined four entries in the map we have used four combinations both key and

48
04:41.120 --> 04:48.940
value as attributes key as attribute value as element value as attribute key as element.

49
04:49.190 --> 04:53.770
And then key and value as elements.

50
04:53.910 --> 04:57.560
Lets run our test and see what happens.

51
04:57.570 --> 05:06.600
Right click run as Java application load said displays the ID which is 20.

52
05:06.610 --> 05:08.400
Let me maximize it.

53
05:08.980 --> 05:14.990
And the values in the map 100 for iPhone 200 for iPad 300 is the key and the value is MacBook Pro

54
05:15.490 --> 05:17.820
and the last one is MacBook Air.

55
05:18.100 --> 05:23.050
So you have successfully created a map using spring configuration.

56
05:23.290 --> 05:27.370
If you go to the config dot xml and also injected it into a Java class.
