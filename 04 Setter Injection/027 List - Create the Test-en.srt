1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,870
The last step is to create a test class and see the dependency injection in action.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:12,080
To do that go to eclipse right click on the package say new class test

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,640
with a main method this class will look exactly same as the earlier test.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,950
But I want you to type so that you will remember the API better after some time you can start copying

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:30,190
and pasting the code classpath XML application context that is what we want to create so new

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:37,120
class path xml application context which takes a location of the file control one assign statement

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,010
to a new local variable call it context on the left hand side instead of classpath application context.

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,550
You can simply use the parent interface which is application context.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:57,000
hit control one import that to provide the file location this time will have to provide the entire package

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,820
because we have put the config under the package.

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,860
So go to hospital grab this package from here.

12
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:11,910
Package name come back to the test paste it and change the dots to forward slashes because there are

13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,070
folders.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,450
The packages will have corresponding folders and that is where it should be searched

15
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,260
Slash list config dot xml

16
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,590
Next step is to get the bean bean context Dot get

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:38,260
Bean within double coats the name of the bin which is Hospital take that paste it here.

18
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,120
Control one.

19
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:47,050
assign statement to a new local variable that will be an object changed to hospital automatically

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:57,950
it will ask for typecasting hit control one add cast so that it will be typecasted to hospital sis out bean

21
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:09,100
lets rename this bean to hospital give it a meaningful name hospital dot get name

22
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,790
that's the first thing then

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:20,680
sis out you can simply print the list hospital dot get the department's  do a control shift f format it.

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,430
In the next lecture will run our test and explain the flow end to end.
