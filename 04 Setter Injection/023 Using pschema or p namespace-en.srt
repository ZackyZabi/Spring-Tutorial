1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,290
You have used value as element and value as attribute.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:10,080
An other way to initialize or inject values or inject dependencies is to use the P schema.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,870
It's a very easy and popular way to do that.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,650
You need the P namespace which is right here and the prefix for it is P.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,540
and this is its namespace. Once we have it,

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,280
We can use the P colon and we need to specify the property which we want to initialize instead of

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,600
defining the property element we use P colon ID on this particular class class object.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,670
I want to initialize the ID to within double coats 20 similarly P colon the second one is

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,490
name that is the property P colon name is equal to within double coats bharath

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,970
and then we don't need any of these.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,760
and this bean element can also end right here.

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,380
Its a convenient and easy.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,130
So this is called the P namespace or P schema way of doing it.

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,070
Let's run our test one more time and see if it still works.

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,290
And the output still remains the same.

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:19,690
So we have finally learnt all the three ways of injecting values using value as element value as attribute

17
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,480
and then the P schema way of doing things.
