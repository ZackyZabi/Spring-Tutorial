1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,400
When we have injected the primitive types you have learned that we can use the value element value as

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,570
element inside the property to do it.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,000
The second variation of value is instead of using it as an element.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,900
We can also use that as an attribute on the property itself.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:22,420
So get rid of this value from here and right on the property element we have a value attribute to which

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,940
we can assign the value and then we don't need this closing tab we can close it right here.

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,260
at the end.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,030
Similarly the second one as well.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,960
Value is equal to bharath.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:46,070
We need the bean get rid of the property and the value, this is called property value as attribute.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,230
And the earlier one is called value as element run the test again.

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,620
Right click run as java application and the output still remains the same.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,610
The dependency injection still works.
