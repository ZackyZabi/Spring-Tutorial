This and the next lecture you will learn how to create and inject a map using spring you are going to

1
00:06.570 --> 00:07.970
work on a very simple use case.

2
00:07.980 --> 00:14.280
you will create a customer class which will have the customer ID and a map that holds all the products

3
00:14.700 --> 00:15.540
the customer has bought.

4
00:15.540 --> 00:22.060
the key is the product ID and the value which is of type string is the product name.

5
00:22.080 --> 00:26.350
Let's get started go do eclipse,

6
00:26.470 --> 00:29.400
right click  new class 

7
00:29.960 --> 00:34.480
Customer is the class name com dot bharath dot

8
00:34.550 --> 00:45.980
spring core dot map finish should have two fields private int ID is the first field.

9
00:46.120 --> 00:58.980
private map of integer key which is the product ID and the product name is string and call it products

10
01:01.120 --> 01:07.460
control one import the map from Java util control one for generating getters and setters

11
01:07.530 --> 01:14.160
hit ok you are welcome to use other shortcuts as well to generate the getters setters exectra click shortcuts

12
01:14.270 --> 01:20.110
Do a control shift F to format and also let's generate a two string method to do that

13
01:20.110 --> 01:24.970
Go to source generate tostring

14
01:25.700 --> 01:31.850
Will use id and products for two strings so that when we print this object later on instead of calling

15
01:31.850 --> 01:36.990
the getter methods we can simply directly print the instance of this and the two string will display the

16
01:37.030 --> 01:41.620
ID and the map control shift  F to format.

17
01:41.630 --> 01:46.880
So in this we have successfully completed the first step of creating the POJO class and the next lecture

18
01:47.210 --> 01:52.200
will create the configuration file which is the key piece and also create the test class.
