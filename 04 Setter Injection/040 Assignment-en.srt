To ensure that you have got everything in setter injection you have to work on an assignment and the

1
00:06.000 --> 00:13.440
assignment is to create a shopping cart class and a item class. An item is a product or several products

2
00:13.530 --> 00:14.820
in a shopping cart.

3
00:14.850 --> 00:23.850
Each item will have an ID name price and quantity and the shopping cart depends on the item.

4
00:23.850 --> 00:31.560
So create these two classes and inject item into shopping cart and inject all these primitive types using pschema

5
00:31.800 --> 00:34.140
if you want to into item.
