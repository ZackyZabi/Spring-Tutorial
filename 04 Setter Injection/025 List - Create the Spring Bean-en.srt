1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,030
This and the next few lectures you are going to create a list and inject it into a Java class using

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,360
spring.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,170
We'll work on a use case which is very simple you will create a hospital POJO class which will have to

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,690
fields the name of the hospital which is a spring and then the list of departments in that hospital

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,140
which is a list of strings will accomplish it in three steps which you already know, you'll first create

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,040
a spring bean which is a plane Java object the hospital class will then create the spring configuration

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,660
file.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,800
Finally we'll create a test class and see the dependency injection of list.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,090
Go to eclipse.

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:51,040
Let's get started let's do the first step of creating the spring bean right click new class call it

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:01:07,420
Hospital lets change the package to dot list finish the hospital class will have private string name of

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:17,280
the hospital private list of strings which are the departments the names of departments save it hit

13
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:26,330
control one import Java dot util dot list control one generate or create getter and setters for this.

14
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,500
We can also do all the getter and setters at once.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,040
For now just use this control one shortcut

16
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,130
control shift F to format.

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,980
So you have successfully completed the first step will do the configuration file and the test class in

18
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,260
the next few lectures.
