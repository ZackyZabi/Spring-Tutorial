1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,150
In this lecture you will learn how to use the list xml element in the configuration file to inject the list

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,510
into a java object.To do that,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,970
go to eclipse will create a new configuration file.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,990
We can also add a bean in the config dot xml but just to show you how to put a config inside a package

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,720
and use it.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,480
Let's create another configuration file.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,750
Copy this paste it on this package just to avoid confusion

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:36,600
Right click on it rename by going to rename or hit F2 change it to list config dot xml

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,200
hit OK get rid of this bean

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,130
dont touch the config dot xml close it open the list config dot xml maximize.

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,940
Delete this

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,900
bean here and let's start from scratch.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,050
Declare a new bean the name of it will be hospital.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:06,200
Class is equal to the entire package name so go to the class grab the package name.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,070
Come back to the conflict paste it

16
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,860
copy it again come back paste it dot hospital.

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,650
That is the instance we want spring to create close it and within the bean element we are going to

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,810
do a setter injection.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,300
The property injection of these two values for the name

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,060
Go here

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,470
Property name is equal to name.

22
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,410
Inside it you can give a value you are welcome to use either the value as attribute or value as element.

23
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:52,330
I'm going to use value as element but the name the hospital name is going to be global hospitals.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
You can list your favorite hospital here

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,760
save it.

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:06,140
The second property going to define it as a List property name is departments copy it comeback

27
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,710
paste it

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,990
The department is not of a value

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,470
It's going to be a list.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,960
This is where we lose the list element

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,280
from spring namespace and within the list we can have multiple values.

32
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,500
Again you can use value as a list of value as a tag or value as an element value as an element or value

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,070
as an attribute.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,740
Let's put three values into this ,list the various departments.

35
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:43,110
I'm going to keep it simple front office inpatient outpatient

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,180
You can list more if you want to and that's it.

37
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,840
So we have successfully configured the hospital bean and we are injecting two fields into it or two

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,870
dependencies into it using the setter injection or the property injection and for the list inside the

39
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,940
property we have used the element called list.
