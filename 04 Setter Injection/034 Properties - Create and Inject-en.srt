Now that you know how to inject list set and a map it's going to be very easy to inject properties into a java

1
00:06.760 --> 00:13.770
class using spring. Will create a class called languages which will have one single field of type

2
00:13.780 --> 00:20.550
java dot util dot properties which will hold a country and its corresponding national language.

3
00:20.850 --> 00:28.990
Let's get started by creating a languages class go to eclipse new class

4
00:32.000 --> 00:33.020
languages.

5
00:34.840 --> 00:39.140
Or let's call it countries and languages.

6
00:39.520 --> 00:53.810
com dot bharath dot springcore dot Properties finish create the one field here private properties

7
00:54.290 --> 01:06.100
from java util country and Langs control one import java dot util dot properties control one again

8
01:07.270 --> 01:09.080
create getters and setters.

9
01:09.200 --> 01:10.990
hit OK save it.

10
01:10.990 --> 01:12.330
Go to source.

11
01:12.560 --> 01:20.050
generate a two string method generate to string by using countries and Langs that's simply going 

12
01:20.050 --> 01:23.520
to display the properties here.

13
01:23.530 --> 01:26.150
The second step is to create the configuration file

14
01:26.290 --> 01:33.640
you can go to the earlier one the map grab the test class as well as the config file paste it on the properties

15
01:33.680 --> 01:40.160
package open up the config will come back to test and fix it.

16
01:40.330 --> 01:44.540
Delete everything inside the bean the name of the bean.

17
01:45.070 --> 01:45.730
Let's call it

18
01:49.800 --> 01:55.430
countries and Langs a long name and the name of the class.

19
01:55.680 --> 02:04.610
We need the package name so go back to the class grab the package name up copy it and come back

20
02:04.610 --> 02:16.160
paste it DOT countries and languages get rid of this P:ID we don't have ID field in this case

21
02:17.030 --> 02:23.930
and to inject the properties first we need to define the property property name is equal to the name

22
02:23.930 --> 02:32.780
of the field or the properties country and langs paste  that and within the property since the value

23
02:32.780 --> 02:39.630
we are injecting or the type of data we are injecting is properties we need to use the spring element

24
02:39.650 --> 02:49.370
called props and within props we can define multiple Prop values which will take a key which is the key

25
02:49.370 --> 02:51.390
of the property.

26
02:51.550 --> 02:52.490
USA

27
02:52.790 --> 02:56.080
And the value can directly go as a text note here.

28
02:56.870 --> 02:59.430
English is the language.

29
02:59.530 --> 03:00.890
Let's add one more entry

30
03:04.960 --> 03:13.510
India and the national language is Hindi, do a control shift F to format and you have successfully injected

31
03:14.410 --> 03:20.880
properties by using props into a java class by using spring.

32
03:21.040 --> 03:28.830
Or at least you have configured now change the test class, class path application context 

33
03:28.950 --> 03:37.870
map will change to properties and we are not going to get a customer will get a countries control space

34
03:37.890 --> 03:45.570
countries and languages copy that paste it on the left hand side change this to countries and langs

35
03:48.090 --> 03:49.370
and paste it here.

36
03:49.570 --> 03:51.490
do a control shift F to format

37
03:51.630 --> 03:59.490
Right click run as Java application that will load the test container we have an exception.

38
03:59.490 --> 04:02.180
Let's see what it is it says no such bean

39
04:02.190 --> 04:02.970
Customer.

40
04:03.090 --> 04:05.670
So we still have customers somewhere right here.

41
04:06.030 --> 04:13.700
So if we try to use customer which is not there in the config Dot xml we get that exception.

42
04:14.070 --> 04:17.580
Let's take a look at the exception one more time.

43
04:17.580 --> 04:21.000
It says No bean name customer available.

44
04:21.150 --> 04:32.480
So let's go back to the test and change the bean name to countries and langs rerun the test again and

45
04:32.650 --> 04:36.800
this time the output is countries and Langs USA English.

46
04:36.930 --> 04:37.920
India Hindi.
