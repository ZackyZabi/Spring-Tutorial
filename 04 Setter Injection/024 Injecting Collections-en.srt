1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,610
So far you have learned and work on injecting primitive types as dependencies.In the next few lectures,

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,960
you will learn how to inject collection types which are the second type supported by spring.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,930
There are four types of collections list, set, map and properties. The list type is represented using

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,860
XML element called list.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,120
Once we use the list spring we'll create a list for us and then it will put whatever values

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,590
we provide using the value element into that list, if we want to add a null value then we use the element

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,700
called Null.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,490
Once you learn how to use list and inject it into a bean through  setter injection it will be very easy

9
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:52,200
to use set because a set is represented using a set element and everything else is similar to how you use a

10
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:00,330
list you assign values to the set using the value elements. Set does not allow duplicates whereas list

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,430
allows duplicate

12
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,690
that's the only difference, next is map.

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:11,490
A map is represented using a map element in the xml configuration and it takes a key value pair

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,420
entries.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:20,040
Many entries can be added to a map this key and value can be attributes on the entry element or there

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,650
can be child elements of the entry element as well.

17
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,970
We will work on all those combinations in the next few like just the final collection is the property.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,150
A property element is represented by props it can have multiple properties inside it to represent

19
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,310
a single property.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,800
We use the prop element with a key attribute and the value will go inside the body of that element.

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:56,300
In this case, I have the languages just as properties key is USA and the language spoken in US is English.

22
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,210
To summarize.

23
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,990
Spring supports four types of collections.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,210
And we can inject them using the list element in the XML

25
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,720
The set element the map which has a child element called entry.

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,570
And finally for properties we use props the child element of it is prop will add multiple properties using

27
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,280
multiple Prop elements.
