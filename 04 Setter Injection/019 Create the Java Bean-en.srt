1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,430
Now that we have the maven project in Eclipse we are going to do dependency injection in three simple

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,130
steps.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,360
The very first step is to create the POJO class that is the java bean to do that,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:20,350
go to eclipse right click on this package here create a new class call it employee this employee

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:30,620
will how to fields in it maximize by double clicking private int ID and id for the employee and a private

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,620
int name of the employee.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,140
We are going to, it will be a string name.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:46,320
They're going to inject these two using spring control one create getter and setter methods for this.

9
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:52,390
Again control one on the name create get and setter for that name as well.

10
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,950
do a control shift F to format it.

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,000
And we have the bean ready.

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,610
That is the employee bean. In the next lecture, will come up with this spring configuration where will

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,230
define our Bean and inject these dependencies.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,340
We can get rid off this app dot java or we are not going to use it right click delete.
