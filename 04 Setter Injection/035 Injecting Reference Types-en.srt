That third and one of the most used Dependency Injection types in real time applications is the reference

1
00:05.880 --> 00:08.210
types or the object types.

2
00:08.460 --> 00:15.570
We use it when a class has a HAS-A relationship with another class that is when a class uses an

3
00:15.570 --> 00:18.130
instance of another class to do its work.

4
00:18.390 --> 00:23.670
Here I have Class A which depends on Class B to get its  work done.

5
00:24.600 --> 00:28.220
We start by creating an instance of Class B.

6
00:29.150 --> 00:35.180
We are asking spring here to create an instance of Class B which is the dependency then we create

7
00:35.240 --> 00:38.530
the dependent class A when we create it

8
00:38.540 --> 00:43.340
We use the setter injection or constructor injection for setter injection we use the property element

9
00:43.790 --> 00:46.400
name is B.

10
00:47.000 --> 00:53.570
And to inject the bean which we have already created we use the ref element to inject reference types  we

11
00:53.570 --> 00:55.280
use the ref element

12
00:55.310 --> 00:57.650
from spring in the spring configuration.

13
00:57.650 --> 01:04.880
This ref element can be used as an element or it can be used as an attribute on the property element.

14
01:04.880 --> 01:11.480
And the third way is to use the P schema where we can get rid of this property itself and use the P

15
01:11.480 --> 01:14.680
schema right on the bean element.

16
01:14.900 --> 01:20.170
Very similar to how you have done it while injecting primitive types will explore all the three ways

17
01:20.210 --> 01:28.010
using reference as a element as an attribute and using P schema to inject object types in the next few

18
01:28.010 --> 01:28.550
lectures.
