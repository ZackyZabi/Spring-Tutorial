In this lecture, I will quickly recap what you have learned from the setter injection section. Setter injection

1
00:06.930 --> 00:14.510
is the process of the spring container using the setter methods on our object to do the dependency injection.

2
00:14.530 --> 00:21.070
We also learnt the three important steps to do dependency injection using spring they are creating the spring

3
00:21.070 --> 00:26.790
beans for our application classes which are pojos plain old Java objects.

4
00:26.800 --> 00:32.970
Second step is to create the spring xml configuration file and provide the spring container the

5
00:33.070 --> 00:35.370
dependency injection information.

6
00:35.440 --> 00:41.280
That is how the beans should be created and what dependency should be injected goes into this particular file.

7
00:42.510 --> 00:47.060
Last but not least get the beans from the spring container and use them

8
00:47.090 --> 00:53.980
either in our test classes or other application classes .There are three different types of data you

9
00:53.980 --> 01:02.800
have injected have injected the primitive types using value as element value as attribute and also using P schema

10
01:02.890 --> 01:08.000
which is a very convenient and easy way to inject dependencies.

11
01:08.050 --> 01:14.440
The second data type is collections and to inject the various collection types we use the collection

12
01:14.440 --> 01:21.990
elements in spring list set map and properties are the xml elements that we have used.

13
01:22.040 --> 01:28.910
Last but not the least objects or reference types can be injected using the ref element inside the bean

14
01:28.910 --> 01:30.120
element property.

15
01:32.170 --> 01:37.570
Ref can be used as an element and also as an attribute on the bean.

16
01:37.610 --> 01:37.970
back.
