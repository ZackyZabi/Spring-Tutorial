1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,420
In this lecture you are going to learn how to create set instance and inject it into a class using

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,720
spring. you will create a car dealer class which will have a string name the name of the dealer and the

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,480
list of models that car dealer sells.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,310
Again you are going to do it in three simple steps create the car dealer POJO or the Spring bean in

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,300
the configuration file and then the test class.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,000
Now that you have done a couple of times it's going to be pretty easy and I'm sure you can wrap it up

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,330
in a single shot.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,580
So let's go to eclipse.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,370
Start by creating a new class the POJO class.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,240
That's the first step.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,410
Car dealer is the class name com dot bharath dot.

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,980
Dot instead of list change to set finish.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:03,630
This class will have two properties private string name private set of strings the models of the card

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,010
or the makes of the vehicle control one import it.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,250
Once you have it imported control one again create getters and setters

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,170
hit OK control one create getters and setters.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,560
OK again do a control shift  F

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,400
to format.

19
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,230
So we are done with the first step which is the creation of the POJO the next step is to create the

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:34,490
configuration file copy over the configuration file from list paste it inside the set.

21
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:47,740
Open it right click rename it to set config everything that applies to a list applies to list to set.

22
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:56,470
So it's very easy to use instead of list change it to a set thats it the list allows duplicates whereas

23
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,790
a set does not allow duplicate.

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,130
So here instead of hospital it's going to be car dealer.

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:15,010
That's the object change the package name from list to set and the class name is car dealer the name

26
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,340
of it.

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,390
You're welcome to use whatever you want.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,610
I'm going to use Hyderabad that's my hometown Hyderabad dealer.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,770
You are welcome to use your home town or your favorite dealer.

30
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,570
And the different types of vehicles if you go back to the class the second property is the models of

31
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:32,990
the cars.

32
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:44,600
You can also have it as makers or companies or branch models Honda BMW

33
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,370
your welcome to add your favorite cars here Hyundai three models.

34
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,370
And that's it.

35
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,770
We have also come up with the configuration file for our car dealer.

36
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:05,140
the last step is the test copy the test paste it open it instead of hospital the bean that will

37
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:16,460
come out is the car dealer and also the structure here will change from list to set car dealer.

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,490
And the name of the bean is car dealer as well.

39
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:29,630
Change all that and from hospital Let's rename this get rid of this sys outs change this to car dealer

40
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,630
as well.

41
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:42,030
Sys out car dealer dot get name and sys out

42
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:54,320
the space car dealer dot get models a control shift f to format.

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,540
Right like run as Java application and we have an error here.

44
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,010
Let's see what's wrong.

45
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,070
Cannot be opened because it does not exist list config is not the file we should change the file name

46
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:20,010
to set config so the exception was it could not find the file that we have specified on that classpath

47
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,260
So it happens if you give it the wrong name.

48
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,870
So instead of set config have given it as list config, it doesn't exist under the package called

49
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,380
Set a folder called set rerun the test again

50
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,590
and the output is Hyderabad dealer and it lists out the three values that we have added to the set.
