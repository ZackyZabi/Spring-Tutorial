00:00.180 --> 00:05.810
In this lecture, will wrap up the last two steps which is creation of the spring configuration file to inject

1
00:05.810 --> 00:08.240
the reference type and the test class.

2
00:08.250 --> 00:17.400
So grab the configuration from earlier packages config and the test copy it and paste it on ref types

3
00:18.430 --> 00:25.660
open the conflict let's config the reference types always start with the dependent or dependency bean.

4
00:25.760 --> 00:29.900
That is in this case student depends on scores.

5
00:29.960 --> 00:34.420
So will start with creating scores first in the config dot xml

6
00:34.550 --> 00:37.070
Let's get rid of everything and start from scratch.

7
00:37.100 --> 00:45.170
Except for the beans element nothing is there in the config dot xml start with bean name is equal

8
00:45.170 --> 00:47.350
to scores

9
00:47.990 --> 00:49.670
Class is equal to

10
00:52.430 --> 00:53.600
scores.

11
00:53.690 --> 00:55.240
We need to grab the package name.

12
00:55.240 --> 01:05.050
Go to the class copy it come back paste it dot close it right there and we can use the P schema

13
01:05.260 --> 01:09.100
to inject the values P colon

14
01:09.340 --> 01:11.000
First one is maths

15
01:11.200 --> 01:12.370
That's the field name

16
01:15.280 --> 01:20.980
let's inject that value is equal to 80 in maths

17
01:21.190 --> 01:23.060
That's a decent score.

18
01:23.080 --> 01:27.790
Physics is equal to 90.

19
01:28.180 --> 01:37.210
And finally P colon chemistry lets say 78.

20
01:37.650 --> 01:44.640
So we have successfully created the first bean or the first object which is required by student.

21
01:44.740 --> 01:51.350
Now let's create the student bean bean name is equal to student.

22
01:51.430 --> 01:56.140
Class is equal to student.

23
01:56.510 --> 01:58.370
Copy the package name from up here.

24
02:00.820 --> 02:02.020
And paste it

25
02:06.260 --> 02:11.250
and inside the bean will use the property.

26
02:13.730 --> 02:20.180
by doing property injection and the name of the property is

27
02:20.280 --> 02:30.060
scores if you go to the student the name of the property is scores copy paste and to inject the ref types

28
02:30.060 --> 02:33.170
we need to use an element called ref

29
02:33.490 --> 02:40.450
ref Bean is equal to specify what is the bean name.

30
02:40.460 --> 02:47.300
So here the bean name is scores so we are going to refer to that paste it and that will inject scores

31
02:47.360 --> 03:00.700
into the scores property of a student.

32
03:00.760 --> 03:04.500
There is a space here the double quotes are not properly ending

33
03:04.840 --> 03:09.190
so ref bean is equal to scores.

34
03:12.250 --> 03:16.220
Go to the test class and make the updates instead of properties.

35
03:16.220 --> 03:18.060
This will be a ref types.

36
03:18.140 --> 03:27.440
That's the package name countries and languages should change to student typecast it to student and the bean

37
03:27.440 --> 03:32.930
we are interested is student although we have two beans in the config dot xml at the end of

38
03:32.930 --> 03:37.740
it we want to get the student and when we display it should also display the scores.

39
03:37.760 --> 03:45.770
So let's implement the tostring method in student as well as inside scores go to source point your

40
03:45.770 --> 03:50.740
cursor to the end of the file go to source generate tostring.

41
03:51.460 --> 03:52.660
Ok.

42
03:53.720 --> 03:55.030
Go to scores

43
03:55.160 --> 04:00.030
Source generate tostring.

44
04:00.540 --> 04:01.690
OK.

45
04:01.780 --> 04:02.570
Save it.

46
04:02.590 --> 04:04.320
Come back to the test class.

47
04:04.330 --> 04:07.620
Student is the name of the bean its typecasted sysout

48
04:07.700 --> 04:18.710
Change this name here to student student CONTROL shift F to format right click its time to run and

49
04:18.710 --> 04:27.790
see reference type injection and it displays the student's course in math physics and chemistry.

50
04:27.820 --> 04:36.610
So we have successfully configured object types and injected one object or reference into another java

51
04:36.610 --> 04:37.120
object.
