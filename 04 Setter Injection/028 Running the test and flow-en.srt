1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,950
This lecture we'll run our test and I will explain what exactly is going on in the background.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,640
So right click on our test class do a run as Java application as soon as we run it

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,780
a spring container is created this pink container loads the configuration file from the classpath

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,140
under this folder structure it will create the hospital bean because that is what we have declared here.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,460
It will create an instance of it.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,190
It will then inject the name property with a value called Global hospital and it will then create

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:39,900
a list and it will inject that list into the departments. Departments property on the hospital,

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,580
that is exactly what we are seeing in the output if I drag this up.

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,190
The name of the hospital is global hospital and the list has three elements or three objects inside it

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,430
front office inpatient and outpatient.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,220
If you want to check out what type off list, list is an interface.

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,050
So we haven't specified whether it should be an array analyst or a linked list.

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,570
So let's check out what type of list is being created.

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,670
You can know that hospital dot get Department dot get class if you do that you will get to know what

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,650
type of list is being created by spring.

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:24,110
So run the program and you will see that its a array list by default,in lecture us later on I will show you

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,360
how to customize it if you want to use a linked list.
